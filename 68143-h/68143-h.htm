<div class='chapter'><h2>Preface</h2></div>

<p>The purpose of this narrative is to hand down
to my children, and to present to my friends, an
intimate, personal account of a life which has not
been without interesting episodes, and which has
been lived during the most eventful period that
this Nation will, in all probability, ever know.</p>

<p>Though a large portion of my story will deal
with incidents which occurred during the great
sectional strife of the sixties, it is not intended as
a history of that great calamity, but is meant,
simply, to be an account of incidents with which
the writer was personally associated.</p>

<p>The Great Strife which so nearly disrupted our
country is over. For many years we of the South
have been dwelling amicably with those of the North—this
is as it should be. We are, united, the greatest
country on the face of God’s footstool. And
to both the North and the South belongs the credit.</p>

<p>The mistakes of certain Northern fanatics,
which were not, I believe, dictated by general
Northern sentiment, have long been rectified. The
Government at Washington today is, I know, truly
representative of the entire country. The tragic
blunders which were evident in the South during
what has been called the “Reconstruction Period”
would not be possible today. The country has become
a unit.</p>

<p>In perfect love and friendship for all the good
people of the United States, irrespective of location,
and with no sectional feeling other than an abiding
love for my South, I write this story. I hope it may
be found to be not without interest.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span><h1>My Earliest Recollections</h1></div>

<div class='chapter'><h2>CHAPTER I</h2></div>

<p>I was born in the city of Bremen, Germany, on
the 18th day of May, 1841. My father was a native
of Prussia, and my mother of the Kingdom of Hanover.
They were married in the city of Bremen in
1839. There were five children born unto them; a
daughter, the oldest of the family, died in Bremen;
the others moved with the family to Texas. I was
educated at a private school, starting at six years
old, up to the time of our removal to Texas in 1853.</p>

<p>In connection with the ordinary literary course,
the French and English languages were taught in
the higher grades in which I had just entered, but
when father decided to move to Texas, he had me
drop the French and employed an additional private
teacher to come to our home and give me English
lessons, which enabled me to speak the English language
on our arrival in Texas.</p>

<p>Our father was a manufacturer of fine mahogany
furniture and established a profitable trade on this
with New York, exporting more of his furniture than
was sold at home, though he had quite an extensive
local trade, as his styles and work were very popular,
all of his furniture being hand carved.</p>

<p>The great Revolution of 1848, which caused great
stringency in financial affairs of the country, forced
him to mortgage his home, and from this he never
recovered. It was this condition that induced his
removal to Texas.</p>

<p>Father and I came to Texas a year in advance
of the balance of the family, for the purpose of getting
acquainted with the country and its conditions.
Then, the year following the rest of the family
came over. We settled in Houston, Texas. We
came over on a large sailing ship, as steamships
were very few, and we came by way of New Orleans,
where we found a great yellow fever epidemic,
though we escaped it this year.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that, when a child about four
years old, I was playing on the river front, sliding
up and down on a plank with one end in the water,
the other end on the steps leading down to the
water, when I lost my hold, slid into the river and
under the bottom of a schooner, coming out on the
opposite side, where one of the sailors caught me
by the hair just as I started under the third time.
I was carried home unconscious. This proved my
first narrow escape from death, of which I had
many during life.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival in Houston, father worked
in an undertaking establishment for a man by the
name of Pannel, but during the first summer, both
father and mother were taken sick with typhoid
fever and died within one week, leaving me, the
oldest of the family, then thirteen years old, to
take care of the rest of the children.</p>

<p>We had an uncle, father’s brother, living on
Spring Creek, in the upper part of Harris County,
who took charge of our sister and a younger
brother until I could make provisions for them to
come back to Houston, there to get the benefit of
the schools.</p>

<p>During the yellow fever of that fall my brother,
next to me, died with yellow fever.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that soon after arrival in
Houston I secured a position in the large retail grocery
establishment of F. Bauman, and, subsequently,
in the wholesale grocery establishment of C. E. Gregory,
where I soon became shipping clerk and an
expert marker of freight, with the marking brush;
so much so that when a lot of freight was turned
out on the sidewalk (to be shipped by ox-wagon,
which was the only means of transportation out of
Houston before the day of railroads) and when
marking this freight, passersby would stop and
watch me, as I was the youngest shipping clerk in
Houston, which of course made me feel very proud.</p>

<p>After a year or more in the service of this
wholesale establishment I was offered a position
in a retail dry goods establishment of G. Gerson,
where I became familiar with the dry goods business.
After about a year, Gerson decided to open
a general merchandise establishment at Waxahachie
and place his cousin, Robert Angleman, in charge
of the same, and, for this purpose, loaded about a
half dozen ox-wagons with part of his Houston stock
and employed me to go to Waxahachie and clerk
for Angleman.</p>

<p>In place of going up to Waxahachie on the stage,
our only means of travel then, I begged them to
allow me to go with the wagons, as I was anxious
to camp out and hunt on the way, but I took a great
fancy to driving one of the wagons, the driver of
which permitted me to learn, and I became somewhat
expert in handling six yoke of oxen, each one
of which had a name, such as “Red” or “Ball,”
or “Jerry.” The oxen seemed to know their names
when called on to move up, followed by the crack
of the big whip, and it is hardly necessary to say
when this outfit entered Waxahachie, preceded
by this team, this little boy was driving, popping
his whip as loud as any of the men. I felt I was
the biggest man among them.</p>

<p>Angleman’s business proved a great success—selling
goods for cash and also taking pecans in
trade for goods at fifty cents a bushel. These
pecans were shipped by wagon to Houston and from
thence to New York, where they netted from sixteen
to eighteen cents per pound. Angleman’s business
was the first Jewish establishment in Waxahachie,
and ultimately grew to be the largest
business in that section of the country.</p>

<p>My sojourn at Waxahachie of about two years
proved the most pleasant of my life, as everybody
seemed to be my friend, and took a special interest
in me because I was the only orphan child in the
place and was without a home. While there I
boarded at both hotels; first at the Rogers House
and next at the Ellis House.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span><h2>CHAPTER II<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>I Abandon the Printer’s Trade and Take Up Surveying.</span></h2></div>

<p>After two years in Waxahachie, I decided to
move back to Houston, where I concluded to learn
the printer’s trade, and for this purpose secured a
position in the office of the Houston Telegraph,
which, at that time, perhaps, had the largest circulation
and was the leading paper in the State. It
was published by Allen &amp; Brockett. Soon after entering
this office and acting as printer’s devil for
a while, they promoted me to the job office, where
I became expert in doing fancy work, such as marriage
notices, ball invitations, etc., but I was unable
to collect any salary; these people were always hard
up for money, and I never got anything out of it
but my board and sufficient money for clothing.
I finally became disgusted and went to Galveston,
where I had an offer from a man by the name of
Spratt, who published a little paper called the Ignis
Fatuous or Jack o’ the Lantern. As the name indicates
it was a humorous paper, containing criticisms
in a humorous vein, of leading politicians of the city
and the State. It was one of the most popular
periodicals then published, selling at ten cents a
copy, by newsboys, without having any left over
each week. Here, too, I failed to get my pay,
though I set up the whole paper and made up the
forms, which were sent up to the Gazette’s office
on Friday, where it was struck off ready for the sale
of the paper on Saturday. I did my work at Spratt’s
home, where he had set apart a room containing
cases. I had board at the same place.</p>

<p>Spratt was a billiard fiend and, as soon as he
got the money for his papers on Saturday, he
would stay in town, play billiards until his money
was exhausted, come home about Tuesday, and then
prepare to furnish matter for the next issue. I
worked with him for about sixty days. Failing
to get my pay, I became disgusted and concluded
that the printer’s trade was a good thing for me
to drop. I then went back to Waxahachie and again
went to work with the Angleman house and formed
the acquaintance of an old land surveyor by the
name of James E. Patton, who employed me to go
with him on surveying expeditions, just for company,
paying me a good salary. I furnished my own
horse and arms, the latter of which he never carried.
He was firm in the belief that Indians would never
trouble him, although it was said that he was taken
prisoner by the Indians, having been caught surveying
lands down on Chambers’ Creek in Ellis
County. They turned him loose, which was considered
one of the most remarkable cases of Indian
generosity ever known on the frontier, as they always
killed surveyors whom they caught locating
land.</p>

<p>It was also related of this old man, that, in the
early days, when he surveyed lands in Ellis County,
he substituted chain carrying by hobbling his ankles
just the length of a vara, and stepped off the
land, in place of measuring it with a chain. Colonel
Patton was one of the most popular surveyors and
land locaters in Texas. His compensation for locating
headright certificates was one-half of the land,
which made him one of the richest men in lands,
at the time of his death, in that section of the State.</p>

<p>My first trip with Colonel Patton was to Fort
Belknap, Texas, where he had formed the acquaintance
of a man by the name of Gibbons, who moved
there from Arkansas and owned about a dozen
negroes, with whom he cultivated a considerable
plantation just across the river from Fort Belknap.
Gibbons had an Indian wife, a Delaware, who was
dark complected like other Indians, but she had a
younger sister, who married General Tarrant, an
old Texas pioneer and Indian fighter, after whom
Tarrant County is named. General Tarrant made
his home in Ellis County and he and Colonel Patton
were great friends. General Tarrant happened to
be on a visit at Gibbons’ when we arrived there on
our first expedition, and we were made to feel at
home before starting out surveying.</p>

<p>It was the custom there for surveyors to make
up a party of a half dozen or more to go on these
expeditions, for protection against Indians who were
then roaming over that whole section of the country.
There was an Indian agency about twelve or fifteen
miles below Belknap, in charge of Captain Shapley
Ross, the father of General L. S. Ross, then a boy
like myself. This agency was composed of remnant
tribes of Indians, probably a half dozen or more,
whom the Comanche Indians had run in off the
range. These Indians had the protection of the
United States Government and, of course, pretended
to be friendly. The most uncivilized Indian in this
agency was the Tonkawa, who, it was claimed, were
cannibals. I remember as we passed through
Keechie Valley, on our way to Weatherford, we
stopped at a store for about an hour, resting and
talking, when the storekeeper told us of a trouble
he came very near having the day before. It seems
a Tonkawa Indian had offered to trade him a pony
for a young Kentuckian, who had just come out
from his State and was clerking in the store. He
asked the Indian what he wanted to do with the
Kentuckian if he accepted his offer. The Indian
told him that he wanted to eat him. The young man
got a gun and was about to shoot the Indian, when
the storekeeper stopped him and made the Indian
leave.</p>

<p>There was another Indian agency at Camp
Cooper, about forty miles west of Belknap, presided
over by a man by the name of Neighbors.
This agency had a tribe of the Southern Comanches,
who were also run in by the Northern Comanches,
or Apaches. These Southern Comanches claimed to
be friendly with the whites in order to have the protection
of the United States Government, but they,
and occasionally the Ross Agency Indians, were believed
to be responsible for many of the raids on
our exposed frontier; especially the Indians at the
upper agency at Camp Cooper. These raids became
frequent; one of them culminating in the murder of
two families in Jack County, and the carrying off of
a little boy and girl as prisoners. Being hotly pursued
by Rangers and citizens, they were forced to
abandon the boy, whom they threw into the brush
to be found by the pursuers. He made the statement
that he was taken upon a horse, behind a
red-headed white man, who seemed to be the leader
of the band. This red-headed white man was seen
in the Indian camp, located up on the Canadian
River, at different times, by scouts.</p>

<p>Major Neighbors, while on a visit to Fort Belknap,
became involved in a dispute with one of the
citizens, who charged that his Indians were responsible
for many of the raids on our frontier. The
dispute resulted in a fight and Major Neighbors
was killed by the citizen. His death created quite
an excitement on the frontier, as he was a United
States officer and the Government asked an investigation
of the affair, but there was never anything
done about it.</p>

<p>While on my first trip with Colonel Patton, while
we were making our headquarters at Gibbons’, we
found General Tarrant and his wife, the sister of
Mrs. Gibbons. This lady, by the way, was as fair
as most of the white women on the frontier. Their
adopted son, Jesse, was about my age. Gibbons
had two sons, one about my age, the other a year
younger. We boys became great friends, and sometimes
engaged in hunting and fishing.</p>

<p>One day we four decided to go fishing at the
mouth of a creek, where it emptied into the Brazos,
about three-quarters of a mile below the house.
We cut fishing poles at a thicket near the creek.
After fishing a while without any result, we got
tired and commenced shooting with our pistols,
of which each had one. All boys of our age always
then went armed with six-shooters, the custom of
the frontier. After shooting at a log in the creek,
thereby emptying our pistols, we did not reload,
not deeming it necessary just then, and decided
to go in bathing in the river. The river being very
low, was only running on the Fort Belknap side,
and we had to walk a considerable distance on a
sand bar to the water. Having just stripped ourselves
of our clothing, ready to go in, we heard
voices calling on the south bank of the river and
discovered a group of men beckoning to us to come
over to them. These proved to be General Tarrant,
Colonel Patton, Gibbons, his overseer and a blacksmith,
who, with his wife, occupied a log cabin
on Gibbons’ place, he being at work for the troops
at the Fort.</p>

<p>When we reached this party of men we were
asked where we had been. When we told them that
we had cut our fishing poles at a thicket, they commenced
laughing and guying this blacksmith, telling
him that his wife had mistaken us for Indians and
concluded that this was a sufficient explanation of
the alarm about Indians that she had created. This
blacksmith insisted on going down to this thicket,
saying that he was satisfied that his wife was not
frightened and made no mistake; that she must
have seen Indians there, but they would not hear
to it, and in going up to the house, stopped at the
cabin and told this woman that it was us boys
that she saw, in place of Indians. She, too, insisted
that they were mistaken, that there were surely
Indians in that thicket, but they paid no further
attention to the matter and went home.</p>

<p>It was the custom there to tie all horses in the
yard, around the house, which was done that night.
When we woke next morning we found all of our
horses gone. When they then investigated the
thicket where we boys cut our fishing poles, they
found plenty of Indian signs, such as small pieces
of buffalo meat and moccasin tracks. The matter,
of course, was reported to the commandant of the
fort, who got his troops ready to start in pursuit
the next evening. This was about the character
of protection afforded by the United States troops.
If rangers had been stationed there, they would
have been in the saddle in less than an hour and
continued the pursuit until the Indians were caught
up with.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span><h2>CHAPTER III<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>Indian Troubles—My First Venture in Business.</span></h2></div>

<p>This bold raid of these Indians stirred up General
Tarrant and he determined to raise about five hundred
volunteers in the frontier counties, to break
up a big Indian camp, under a celebrated chief,
Buffalo Hump, that was known to exist on the
North Canadian, and for this purpose he canvassed
the frontier counties and had no trouble in having
volunteers sign to go out on the expedition. He
fixed the time of departure from Fort Belknap on
the fourth day of July, which was most unfortunate,
as the time of his canvass was in the early part of
May, when during the long interim the Indians had
been quiet, and had made no raids into the settlements.
The volunteers who subscribed had lost
interest in the matter and would not go.</p>

<p>I was one of twenty who subscribed to go from
Ellis County, and believe I was the only one that
ever started. About this time Colonel Patton had
arranged to start on another surveying expedition,
in conjunction with a party of surveyors, in charge
of Gid Rucker, who had a contract for running
the center line of a twenty-mile reserve, granted
by the State to the Memphis &amp; El Paso Railroad
Company. This center line was run on the thirty-second
parallel. Colonel Patton went along to locate
land certificates, of which he had a great many,
and was anxious to see the country up on Hubbard’s
Creek in Young County. Hubbard’s Creek
is a tributary of the Clear Fork of the Brazos.</p>

<p>When we reached Weatherford we found General
Tarrant very sick, not expected to live, and
he died a few days afterwards, which, of course,
broke up the expedition for which I had enlisted.
Colonel Patton then induced the railroad company’s
surveyors to make me a proposition and pay me
two dollars per day to simply go along as company,
they being anxious to have a sufficient crowd to
overawe any attack Indians might contemplate.</p>

<p>After reaching the eightieth milepost, Colonel
Patton had them run down ten miles to the southern
boundary of the reserve, which was done, and a
most magnificent country developed. It seems
Colonel Patton had requested Mr. Rucker to get
a sketch of that section of the country from the
General Land Office at Austin, and gave him money
to pay for such sketch, and when he asked for this
sketch Rucker told him that they told him at the
Land Office that the whole country was vacant;
that there had been no surveys recorded in that
section. Colonel Patton then struck out alone, riding
around and, after a few hours’ investigation, became
disgusted, having found quite a number of rock
piles and blazed trees, indicating that the country
was not vacant and had been well surveyed over
by others.</p>

<p>Colonel Patton then told me that he was going
back home, his whole trip was a failure, that he
wouldn’t stay with a crowd that had deceived him
so grossly. He planned to go back by himself, but
I told him he should not do so—if he was going
back I would go with him. The whole party started
back to the center line, where we quit work. It was
now late at night, the moon shining brightly, and
we were about ten miles away from water, which
we needed for our horses, before we could go into
camp. After riding over the high, rolling prairie on
this beautiful night, some seven or eight miles,
coming over a ridge we discovered a few camp fires
in the bottom of Hubbard’s Creek, which, of course,
were thought to be Indian fires by our party. After
consultation, we decided to make a charge on them
and scatter them. For this purpose we drew up
in line, having altogether about twenty men, and
moved on them cautiously. When within a few
hundred yards of the bottoms, we were halted by
a vidette picket, who from his brogue, proved to
be an Irishman. This indicated to our party that
the camp was of United States troops, and not
Indians.</p>

<p>On arriving in camp we found Major Van Dorn
with a troop of cavalry, on his way from Fort Phantom
Hill to Camp Cooper. The major, of course,
was glad to have us camp with him. During the
night, Mr. Rucker learned that Colonel Patton intended
going straight for the settlements, without
company except myself. Major Van Dorn sent for
Colonel Patton and begged him to go to Camp
Cooper with him, where he would no doubt find
company from there to Fort Belknap, and then
again from Fort Belknap to Weatherford, all of
which were dangerous routes for one or two men
to travel alone, on account of Indians, but Colonel
Patton wouldn’t listen to such advice, claiming the
Indians would never bother him and he would have
no trouble in getting back to the settlements with
me.</p>

<p>The next morning we struck out in a straight
line for the settlements, all alone, without taking
any provisions, as the old man was mad with
Rucker and would not ask for them, nor accept any
when they were offered.</p>

<p>This ride to the settlements proved one of the
most trying the old gentleman had ever been subjected
to. It was, likewise, for me. We were without
water for a day and a half, when we struck
running water in the North Fork of Palo Pinto,
and the second evening, late, we found a small cornfield,
about three or four acres, with a board shed
and a pile of ashes, indicating that this corn was
made by some parties who had camped there and
finally abandoned on account of Indian depredations.
We then found a well-beaten path from this,
leading in the direction we were traveling. About
six or eight miles from there we found a house, the
home of a frontier settler, with a wife and two
children. All were much rejoiced at seeing us and
insisted on our staying a week, which, of course,
we had to decline and left the next morning, on our
way home to Waxahachie, which was reached in due
time. This ended my frontier visitation, determined
never to go outside of the settlements again, which I
never did.</p>

<p>Soon after reaching Waxahachie, I was induced
to accept a position with a Mr. Leander Cannon at
Hempstead, Austin County, who was then conducting
the largest mercantile business in that section
of the State. After serving about a year in the dry
goods and clothing department, I was induced by
Mr. Cannon to take charge of his books, which I
did for about six or eight months, when he decided
to sell out and offered me his business, giving me
all the time I needed to pay for it, if I would enter
into copartnership with one J. W. Fosgard, his
former bookkeeper, who was an educated, college
man, from Sweden. Fosgard was very egotistic and
overbearing and I knew we could never get along,
therefore, I declined Mr. Cannon’s generous offer.
He sold out to Fosgard alone.</p>

<p>A short time after, I had an invitation to join
R. P. Faddis in the purchase of the business of
Young &amp; Bush, who, at the time, had a better stock
of goods than Cannon and made us a very attractive
offer, giving us all the time we wanted to pay
them. This offer we accepted, constituting the
firm of Faddis &amp; Graber. Faddis was the bookkeeper
of Young &amp; Bush, and was a very popular
man with the trade, which was largely composed
of the leading and richest planters in that section
of the Brazos country, and we soon built up a
profitable business, though unfortunately, for us,
our country soon became involved in sectional
troubles, which prevented our restocking our reduced
stock of goods and finally culminated in
secession and war.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span><h2>CHAPTER IV<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>My First Military Experiences.</span></h2></div>

<p>R. P. Faddis was a native of Minnesota, raised
and educated there, and was about nine years my
senior. He was more familiar with the true conditions
in the North than I was.</p>

<p>When war was threatened, before Sumter was
fired on, minute companies were organized in many
of the important towns of Texas; forts and arsenals
on our frontiers were taken possession of by the
State, and the garrisons shipped North. A Captain
Stoneman collected about five hundred picked
troops at Fort Brown and refused to surrender.
Colonel Ford, an old commander of Texas Rangers,
collected about three hundred men and demanded
the surrender of the fort, which was refused.</p>

<p>An old New Orleans boat, called the General
Rusk, was dispatched to Galveston for reinforcements.
On its arrival there, telegrams were sent to
Houston, Hempstead and Navasota, which places
had organized companies, for the companies to report
by twelve o’clock that night for passage on
the General Rusk, for Brazos, Santiago. Twelve
o’clock that night found four companies aboard of
this boat, coasting down the Gulf in a storm, without
ballast, rolling and making us all seasick; nearly
five hundred men lying on the lower deck. We
finally arrived at Brazos Santiago, where we found
some other citizen soldiers in the old army barracks,
including the Davis Guards, under command of Captain
Odium and Dick Dowling.</p>

<p>After two weeks’ camping on Brazos Santiago
Island, Captain Stoneman surrendered Fort Brown,
and, after disarmament, was sent North with his
troops. We then returned home and resumed our
civic avocations.</p>

<p>We next organized a cavalry company, commanded
by a Captain Alston; Hannibal Boone, First
Lieutenant, and W. R. Webb, Second Lieutenant.
I was offered the second lieutenancy, but declined,
saying I would only serve in a private capacity. I
was not a military man, and never expected to be.
In about thirty days we were called to hasten to
Indianola on horseback, where they had collected
more troops, which had refused to surrender. We
immediately started there and, when near Victoria,
we got information that these troops had also surrendered,
making it unnecessary to go any further,
and we again returned home to resume our several
pursuits. The company then disbanded and largely
merged into a new company, organized for frontier
protection against Indians. I remained at home,
attending to my business with Faddis.</p>

<p>A couple of young Englishmen had come to
Hempstead about a year before and started a foundry
and machine shop, the second one in the State.
They were both experts in their business and good
men, receiving the financial support of the community,
and soon owed our firm a large amount of
money for advances to their hands and monies
loaned.</p>

<p>In July, 1861, the same year, Colonel Frank Terry,
a large sugar planter in Fort Bend County, and
Thomas Lubbock of Houston, returned from the
battle of Manassas, where they had served as volunteer
aides on the staff of General Beauregard and
through their intrepid daring and valuable services,
were commissioned to raise a regiment of Texas
Rangers.</p>

<p>Immediately upon their return, they issued a call
for volunteers, to serve during the war, in Virginia;
the men to furnish their own equipment. The response
was prompt; in less than thirty days ten
companies of over one thousand men were on their
way to Houston to be mustered into the service of
the Confederate States Army for the war. The personnel
was of the highest order, some of the best
families in South Texas were represented, many
were college graduates, professional men, merchants,
stockmen and planters; all anxious to serve
in the ranks as privates; all young, in their teens
and early twenties; rank was not considered and
when tendered, refused; the main desire was to get
into this regiment.</p>

<p>I told Faddis our firm must be represented, on
which we agreed, and that I wanted to join, but he
insisted that it was his time to go, that I had been
out twice, and I finally had to yield him the right.
He then subscribed to join. The day he was ordered
to Houston to be mustered in, he declined to
go and frankly told me that he only signed to keep
me from going, and he did his best to persuade me
not to go. He said that the South was deceived in
the spirit and strength of the North; that the North
had every advantage of us—they had the army and
navy, the arsenals, the treasury and large manufactories,
as well as five men to our one; the whole
world open to them, while we had nothing, our ports
would be blockaded and we would be forced to depend
upon our own limited resources, and, as to
relying upon the justice of our cause, in the language
of Abraham Lincoln, “might was right and would
surely conquer.” I told him I could not agree with
him and was satisfied the war would not last three
months. As soon as we could drive these people
back into their own territory, they would be willing
to let us alone. “I am going to take your place,
Faddis.” I had about an hour to arrange for board
for my young brother and sister and Faddis agreed
to look after them and pay their board out of my
interest in the business, which he pledged himself
to continue for our mutual benefit.</p>

<p>When we parted I expected to return inside of
three months; he expected he would never see me
again, as I might be killed and, if I should return,
that I would be a crippled, subjugated man.</p>

<p>Faddis continued the business as far as he was
able and finally, to protect us, had to take over
the foundry and machine shop, arranging with our
Englishmen to run it for him. He then, to keep out
of the army, turned his attention to repairing old
guns, making swords and other arms, and finally,
on the persuasion of his English friends, cast a
nine-inch Armstrong gun, the only one ever successfully
made in the Confederacy.</p>

<p>This drew the attention of the Confederate Government,
who impressed our property, paid him
eighty thousand dollars for it and gave him a permit
to stay in Brownsville and run cotton into
Mexico, returning with goods.</p>

<p>On my return from the army, after four years,
I heard of him through a party who knew him in
Brownsville. This party reported that Faddis had
more gold than he knew what to do with, and I concluded
that I was fixed, too, but I was unable to communicate
with him, as we had no mails, and did not
hear from him until after two years, when he returned
to Hempstead broke. He had lost all in
grain speculations in Chicago.</p>

<p>I next proceeded to Houston, where I was mustered
in with the balance of the regiment, to serve in
Virginia, during the war. While in camp at Houston,
we organized our company, electing John A. Wharton
of Brazoria County captain of the company;
who, on his election, made up a speech, in which he
said that he had no ambition to gratify more than
to command Company B, that he expected to return
captain of Company B and did not want any promotion.
He was offered by the balance of the regiment
in connection with our company, the office of
major. The balance of the commissioned officers
of the company were Clarence McNeil, first lieutenant
and Theodore Bennett, second lieutenant; and
the noncommissioned officers were distributed
among the different sections from which the company
was made up; nobody caring for an office of
any kind, as a private was generally the equal of
any officer in command. All went to do their
patriotic duty and contribute their mite for the
success of the cause.</p>

<p>We now started on horseback. After reaching
Beaumont we returned our horses to Texas, having
to take boat to Lake Charles, Louisiana, from
whence we were forced to walk to New Iberia, carrying
our saddles and other equipment on wagons,
across the country. At New Iberia we again took
boat for New Orleans; this was the only route open,
as our ports had been blockaded for some time,
both at Galveston and at the mouth of the Mississippi
River.</p>

<p>During our stay in New Orleans for three or four
days, we had a good rest and waited for the balance
of the companies to catch up. Colonel Terry received
a telegram from General Albert Sidney Johnston
at Bowling Green, Kentucky, stating that he
had been ordered to take command in Kentucky,
and requested Colonel Terry to urge the men to
come and serve under him and, by way of inducement,
authorized him to say that we should be
mounted on the best horses that Kentucky afforded
and that we should always remain a separate and
distinct command, never to be brigaded with any
other troops as long as he lived. General Johnston
was well acquainted with the character of Texans,
regarding them as fearless and enthusiastic people,
proud of their Texas history; and, knowing the
young men composing this regiment would endeavor
to emulate the example of the heroes of the Alamo,
Goliad and San Jacinto, on which point, he was not
mistaken. General Johnston had been connected
with the army, under General Houston, and had also
engaged in sugar planting near the Kyle and Terry
plantation in Fort Bend and Brazoria Counties,
where a great friendship sprang up between him
and Colonel Terry. Colonel Terry’s influence with
the men of the regiment was unlimited and he had
no trouble in persuading the men to accept General
Johnston’s offer and serve with him in Kentucky.</p>

<p>While in New Orleans Colonel Terry made an
official visit to General Twiggs, an officer of the
old army, who had resigned, and tendered his services
to the Confederacy, and who was then in command
at New Orleans and the Southwestern territory.
Colonel Terry, while there, asked information
on the matter of obtaining cooking utensils and tents.
When General Twiggs, who had served many years
on the frontier of Texas, laughed him out of countenance,
saying, “Who ever heard of a Texas Ranger
carrying cooking utensils and sleeping in a tent?”
It is needless to say that this matter was not mentioned
again by Colonel Terry.</p>

<p>Our company arrived at Nashville, Tennessee,
ahead of the balance of the regiment, where we were
quartered in the Fair Grounds, there to await the
arrival of the rest of the companies. I forgot to
mention we started out with the name of the “Texas
Rangers,” with a reputation we had never earned,
but were called on to sustain; how well we did it,
we leave history to record our services during the
four years we served the Army of the West. While
I would not make any invidious distinction as between
our regiment and others who served under
Forrest, Wheeler and Wharton, I am proud to be
able to say that opportunities were afforded us,
largely by accident, that demonstrated our ability
to meet every expectation of department commanders,
as evidenced by the following expressions during
the war:</p>

<p>“With a little more drill you are the equals
of the old guard of Napoleon.”—General Albert
Sidney Johnston. “I always feel safe when the
Rangers are in front.”—General Wm. J. Hardee.
“There is no danger of a surprise when the Rangers
are between us and the enemy.”—General Braxton
Bragg. “The Terry Rangers have done all that
could be expected or required of soldiers.”—Jefferson
Davis.</p>

<p>While camped in the Fair Grounds, the citizens
of Nashville, largely ladies, came rolling in, in carriages
and buggies; all anxious to see the Texas
Rangers, about whom history had written so much
about their fearlessness and being great riders.
Colonel Terry called on not a few of our men to
ride horses that were taken out of buggies and
carriages, for the purpose of showing their horsemanship—the
most popular feature being a deposit
of gold coins on the ground, the rider to run at full
speed, stooping down and picking them up. This
extraordinary feat, in connection with their general
appearance; being armed with shotguns, six-shooters
and Bowie knives, seemed to sustain their idea
of the Texas Rangers that fought at the Alamo,
Goliad and San Jacinto and served under Jack
Hayes, Ben McCollough and other Indian and Mexican
fighters. The regular army equipment for
cavalry was the saber, the carbine and six-shooter.
This difference in equipment alone indicated that
the Texas Ranger expected and would fight only in
close quarters. After a pleasant stay at Nashville
of nearly two weeks, we were ordered to go by
rail to Bowling Green, Kentucky, where we found
an army of infantry and artillery and three regiments
of cavalry. Here we drew our horses by
lot and it was my good fortune to draw first choice
out of about a thousand horses tied to a picket rope.
When all were ready to make their selection I was
directed to where these horses were tied and ordered
to make my selection, which I was not permitted
to do with any degree of deliberation. Having about
a thousand men waiting on me, all anxious to make
their selection, a comrade, seeing I was confused
and embarrassed, offered to exchange his thirty-second
choice for my choice, paying me a liberal
bonus. I was glad to accept it, mainly to get time
to look around among the rest of the horses, believing
I would stand a better chance to get a good
mount. I had got short of money by that time, as
we paid our own expenses, except transportation,
and this comrade was glad to pay me for my first
choice. We had no time to take out a horse and
try his gaits, and it proved largely guesswork in the
selection of the horses. The best gait for cavalry
service is a long swinging walk and fox trot; unfortunately
my thirty-second choice proved a pacer.</p>

<p>After drawing our horses and preparing everything
ready for active service, the regiment under
Colonel Terry was ordered on a scout to Glasgow,
Kentucky, where we were kindly received by its citizens
and took up our quarters at the Fair Grounds.
Here the regiment spent several days pleasantly,
feasting on the good things brought in by the ladies
of the town.</p>

<p>The second day Colonel Terry ordered Captain
Ferrell, with his company and Company B, of which
I was a member, to the little town of Edmonton, Kentucky,
where it was reported a part of a regiment
of Federal cavalry were quartered.</p>

<p>We started at night, which proved to be one of
the coldest we had ever been out in, riding all night.
When nearly daylight, we reached the suburbs of
the town. I was riding a very spirited and nervous
horse, which refused to be quieted, while riding in
line. In order to keep him quiet, I had loosened the
strap on his curb, which proved to be a mistake.
Nearing the town, the order came down the line
“Silence in ranks,” and soon my horse got to prancing.
I jerked him by the reins, throwing him on his
haunches, when the hammer of my shotgun struck
the horn of the saddle and fired off my gun, which
raised the alarm in town. Immediately the order
was given “Form fours; Charge!” which excited my
horse to such an extent that he broke ranks and
flew up the line to the front. Carrying my shotgun
in my right hand, I was unable to check him
without the curb and he ran away with me, carrying
me up into the town on the square, about three
hundred yards in advance of my command, where
I succeeded in checking him. For this I was reprimanded
by Captain Ferrell, who would not receive
my explanation that the horse ran away with me
and claimed that I was too anxious to get there first.</p>

<p>Had the garrison not received information that
we were moving on them for an attack and left
during the night for Mumfordsville, instead of occupying
the town as we expected, I no doubt would
have been killed in this, our first charge.</p>

<p>Captain Ferrell had orders from General Johnston
to try to capture a spy by the name of Burrell,
who was making this town his headquarters and who
always stopped at the hotel. As soon as we entered
the square we were ordered to surround the hotel,
which was done promptly. Captain Ferrell then
called the proprietor to the door, told him to tell
the ladies in the house to rise and dress, as he would
have to search the house for Burrell. The hotel
man said that Burrell was there the evening before,
but left for Mumfordsville and was certainly not
in the house. Captain Ferrell told him that it made
no difference, but to hurry up, he was going to
search the house.</p>

<p>The house was partly a two-story building, which
had been added to the gable end of the one-story
building and the stair landing, built against the
gable of a one-story house, with a solid wood shutter
covering, and opening into the attic of the one-story
building. The ladies took their own time about
getting ready for our search, perhaps nearly an
hour; some of them in the meantime coming to
the door and repeating the proprietor’s statement—that
Burrell had left the evening before. When
they announced ready, I being near the door, dashed
in ahead of all the rest and up the stairs, when I
discovered the wooden shutter, which I jerked open,
peering into the dark attic. Daylight had now
fairly lit up the surroundings and I discovered,
through the light of the cracked shingles, what I
took to be a bundle of clothing at the far end,
under the corner of the roof. I cocked both barrels
of my gun and called out, “Come out; I see you;
I’ll shoot if you don’t.” He answered, “Don’t
shoot.” If he had not answered I, no doubt, would
have concluded, and perhaps others that followed
me, too, that it was an old bundle of plunder. Proceeding
down stairs with the prisoner, Burrell, who
proved to be quite an intelligent and good-looking
gentleman, I carried him into the parlor, where the
ladies had congregated. They were all in tears, with
some of our boys laughing at them and telling them
they were story tellers.</p>

<p>Captain Ferrell, immediately on entering the
square, detailed two men for each road leading into
the town, to picket these roads about one-half mile
from town. We built log fires on the square to keep
us warm during the day until about three o’clock
in the evening. A citizen then came in and, in an
excited manner, told Captain Ferrell that a large
cavalry force was moving in between us and Glasgow,
with a view of cutting us off from our main
command. The pickets arrested everybody coming
into town and by three o’clock we had about fifteen
or twenty prisoners, including some four or five
Federal soldiers, who rode in on them, thinking the
town was still occupied by Federal troops. On
receiving information about this large cavalry
force moving on a road between us and Glasgow,
Captain Ferrell gave the order to mount and form
fours, selecting what prisoners (about seven or eight,
including Burrell) and the soldiers, to take with us,
and turning the balance of them loose. He then
placed me in charge of the prisoners, with four
others to help guard them. We then commenced
our retreat to Glasgow. When about three miles
from town, another citizen dashed up to Captain
Ferrell, who rode in advance of the column, and
reported the same large cavalry force occupying our
road some few miles ahead of us. Captain Ferrell,
who, by the way, was an old frontiersman, Indian
and Mexican fighter, dropped back and ordered
me to tie Burrell’s ankles together, under the
horse’s body and if we got into a fight and he
attempted to escape, to not fail to kill him the first
one. I don’t think I ever did anything during the
war that I hated as bad as I did to tie this man’s
ankles under the horse, but it was my orders from
a man I knew would not permit any plea for its
modification, and I had to obey.</p>

<p>After riding about eight or ten miles, in this
way, feeling sorry for Burrell in his pitiful plight,
I couldn’t stand it any longer and told him if he
would promise me he would not make a break when
the guns opened, that I would unloose the ropes and
free his legs, for which he thanked me. Then I
told him to be careful and carry out his promise,
for if he did attempt a break, I would surely shoot
him.</p>

<p>It seems that the report of these citizens proved
only a ruse to induce us to liberate our prisoners,
as we were never fired on or again heard of any
Federal Cavalry in our front and safely reached
Glasgow, where we still found the balance of the
regiment in camp.</p>

<p>Colonel Terry sent our prisoners to Bowling
Green, highly pleased with the capture of Burrell,
for whom he had a special order by General Johnston.
I am satisfied Burrell was sent to Richmond,
Virginia, and was ultimately exchanged, as I saw
the name of a Colonel Burrell, commanding Kentucky
troops mentioned in a war history, published
in the North some years after the War and on which
point I trust I was not mistaken, and that he is still
in the land of the living.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span><h2>CHAPTER V<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>Our First Engagement</span></h2></div>

<p>We now took up our line of march for Ritters,
a point on the Louisville &amp; Nashville Pike, between
Cave City and Woodsonville, with Hindman’s Brigade
of infantry and a battery of four pieces,
camped at Cave City, a few miles in our rear, and
established our permanent camp, for the purpose of
scouting and picketing. This camp at Ritters in
winter proved to be a very trying one to us, raised
in Texas in a mild and genial climate. We had a
great deal of snow and rain and the exposure on
scouts and picket duty soon developed pneumonia,
measles and other troubles, necessitating our patients
to abandon camp life. They were sent
to the hospital at Nashville, where the ladies of
Nashville were daily awaiting trains. They would
not permit patients to be carried to the hospital
but would take them to their private homes for
personal care and treatment. They showed a partiality
for the Texas Rangers, no doubt largely
through sympathy, as we had left our distant, comfortable
homes, burning all bridges behind us, to
fight for them and their country. Our regiment
soon dwindled down from a membership of one
thousand to not more than about four hundred
for duty; many of the sick were permanently rendered
unable to return, while a great many died.</p>

<p>After serving nearly a month in the capacity of
picket and scouts, General Hindman, anxious to
bring on an engagement with the enemy, who were
camped on Green River at Woodsonville and Mumfordsville,
conceived the idea of moving his camp.
Instead of avoiding a collision, as he had orders to
do, he moved right toward the enemy’s lines, ordering
Colonel Terry, with our regiment, to move about
a mile in his advance.</p>

<p>I was on picket duty, with part of a company, at
Horse Cave, about three miles south of the main
pike from Bowling Green to Louisville, when Captain
Ferrell of the regiment, with part of his company,
came by and took us along, moving towards
Woodsonville on a dirt road running parallel with
the pike on which were Hindman’s Brigade of infantry;
with the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad
running between the two. Just as we came in sight
of Rowlett Station, a point on a high ridge this side
of Woodsonville, we discovered the regiment, with
Colonel Terry and General Hindman about fifty
feet in advance, moving in the direction of Rowlett
Station. Colonel Terry and General Hindman then
discovered a Federal line of infantry lying down
behind a rail fence in front of them. Hindman’s
infantry were at least a mile behind, coming on,
when they discovered the enemy. General Hindman
ordered Colonel Terry to withdraw the regiment and
let him bring up the artillery and infantry, and
dislodge them from their position. In the meantime,
Captain Ferrell, in command of the party I was
with, had discovered the enemy in our front, which
was just across a railroad cut, spanned by the
pike bridge. Colonel Terry, in place of obeying the
order of General Hindman to withdraw, answered,
“General Hindman, this is no place for you; go back
to your infantry,” and called on Captain Walker,
who was in the rear with the balance of the regiment,
to come on, form into line and charge.
Simultaneously with his charge on the west side of
the railroad, we, under Ferrell, charged the enemy
in front of us, behind the rail fence. As soon as
we moved forward, other Federals, behind trees and
rocks, on small hills on both sides, opened fire on us.
Their troops behind the fence held their fire until
we got within fifty yards of them, then turned loose.
In less time than it takes to tell it, we charged them,
delivering our fire of double-barreled shotguns,
breaking down the fence and getting among them
with our six-shooters. In a few minutes we had
run over them, although they numbered two to one,
and to save themselves many of them “possumed”
on us, and feigned being dead, and by that means
saved their lives, though the main portion of them
fled towards Woodsonville, where, down in the
edge of the timber, they were met by heavy reinforcements.
In this charge we lost a number of our
best men, killed and wounded. Among the killed
was Colonel Terry, which proved an irreparable
loss, as no doubt, considering his fearlessness and
dash, as also his ability as a commander, he would
have proven another Forrest, a Napoleon of cavalry.
General Hindman brought up his infantry and artillery,
a battery of four pieces, with which he
opened on their fort at Mumfordsville, and also on
their line of infantry in the woods about a half
mile below us. The fort responded, but largely overshot
us and our battery. This proved our first baptism
by fire. General Hindman was notified by a
scout that the enemy was crossing Green River in
very heavy force, near the Mammoth Cave, moving
in our rear, which necessitated falling back to Cave
City. We brought off the bodies of our dead and
wounded, the remains of Colonel Terry being sent
to Texas in charge of Captain Walker, who was
wounded, and the balance of the wounded were
sent to hospitals at Nashville.</p>

<p>The enemy we fought at this point proved to be
the Thirty-second Indiana Regiment, under Colonel
Wilich, a German regiment, said to be the best
drilled regiment in Rousseau’s Army.</p>

<p>We next established our camp at Bell Station,
a few miles in advance of Cave City, where we continued
scouting and picketing for the army. Both
armies now remained quiet for several months, collecting
reinforcements for a final clash; the rigors
of the winter affecting our army perhaps more than
it did the Federal army, as they were used to a
colder climate. Our regiment was especially
affected.</p>

<p>While encamped at Bell Station, I had a messmate
by the name of McDonald, who was taken
sick with pneumonia and was unwilling to be sent
to the hospital at Nashville. He insisted on being
taken to some good private family in the neighborhood.
I succeeded in finding the family of Isaac
Smith, an old gentleman who had six sons in Breckenridge’s
Brigade of infantry, and living about three
miles from our picket stand with his wife and two
daughters. These good people were willing to take
McDonald and nurse him, our own surgeon attending
him and myself assisting in nursing him, frequently
spending the night there. The oldest daughter
was also very sick, attended by a citizen doctor
in the neighborhood, who also took a deep interest
in McDonald.</p>

<p>One day I received orders to report to the command;
that Bowling Green was being evacuated.
We were ordered to join the army as quickly as
possible, Hindman’s Brigade having already arrived
at Bowling Green. This information proved to
be bad news for McDonald, who was already convalescent,
but still very weak. He begged and
pleaded to be taken to Bowling Green and Nashville,
saying he did not want to be captured. Old
Mr. Smith, then perhaps fifty-five years old, decided
to hitch up his wagon, as he had no buggy
or hack, and haul McDonald to Bowling Green in
a wagon, as he wanted to refugee and stay with
his boys in the army; he feared to stay at home,
surrounded by ugly Union neighbors.</p>

<p>We now put a mattress in the wagon, with plenty
of bedclothing. We put McDonald in the wagon,
well protected from the cold, and, after a sad parting
with the family, proceeded to the Bowling Green
pike, the old man driving the wagon and I following
on my horse. We reached Bowling Green near
night, just in time to witness the last cannon shot
striking one of the main pillars of the railroad
bridge, which was an iron extension, and saw it
drop into the river. We crossed on a covered wooden
pike bridge.</p>

<p>On our arrival in town, we inquired for a good
place to leave McDonald for the night, which we
were unable to find, but were recommended to go
out about two miles to a Mr. Roe’s, who had a large
flouring mill. This we did, and found excellent
quarters for McDonald and myself for the night;
old Mr. Smith driving back to town and taking the
Nashville pike to try to find Breckenridge’s Brigade
of Infantry, with which his sons were connected.</p>

<p>During the night we had a very heavy snow.
Mr. Roe had his buggy hitched up and drove McDonald
to the railroad station in town, myself following.
Roe was unable to remain with us, as we
were expecting the enemy to cross the river any
moment and enter the town, hence left us by the
side of the track and returned home.</p>

<p>After a while, Colonel Wharton, with about
fifteen or twenty men out of our regiment, was
ordered to destroy the depot and proceeded to fire
it. A train with a few passenger coaches and an
engine to pull it, was standing on the track on the
outside, waiting for orders to move. A good many
convalescent soldiers from the hospital, including
my friend McDonald, squatted down by the roadside,
waiting for the coaches to be opened. As soon
as the fire started in the station, the enemy opened
a battery on the place, using shells, which exploded
all around us. The engineer got scared, uncoupled
his engine and pulled out, leaving our train at the
mercy of the artillery fire. Looking around for
some kind of a vehicle to take McDonald out of
there, as he was too feeble to attempt to ride my
horse, I rode up town and found a two-horse wagon,
loaded with hams, flush to the top of the bed, which
the driver had taken from our commissary building
and was hauling home. I stopped and told him that
I had a sick friend down at the station; that I
wanted him to go down there and haul my friend
away. He said he wouldn’t go down there for anything
in the world. I pulled out my gun and told
him to go; and he went.</p>

<p>Arriving at the place, we cut open some infantry
baggage that had blankets tied to the knapsacks and
put about a half dozen blankets on top of the hams,
lifting McDonald and laying him on top, covering
him with more blankets. In the meantime, the station
was about consumed and the artillery had
ceased firing. After getting up on the square and
finding our troops had all left, I told this man that
he would have to drive on the Nashville Pike until
we could catch up with our command, which he did
most reluctantly and only under the persuasion of
my gun.</p>

<p>About a mile and a half below town we found
our regiment drawn up in line of battle. I sent for
our surgeon, who examined McDonald and said to
the driver, “You will have to drive on down the
road until we catch up with my ambulances.” The
driver said that he wouldn’t go any further; said I,
“If you don’t, we will have to hold on to this team
until we unload; I am going to save these hams
for our regiment.” They were meat that belonged
to our commissary. He said that he wouldn’t go
any further, that we could take his team and wagon
and go to —— with it. The fellow was evidently
afraid that we would force him into the army; he
thereby lost his team and wagon, which we had no
idea of taking, and he could have saved them by
continuing with us.</p>

<p>Our army now took up its long line of retreat
for Nashville; our regiment covering the rear without
any engagements, or the firing of a single gun.
On reaching Nashville, crossing the Cumberland
River on the suspension bridge about midnight, we
got information that Port Donaldson had surrendered,
which made it necessary for our troops to
leave Nashville in great haste, which they did; protected
in the rear by our regiment. The army continued
to Shelbyville, while we were ordered to
Fort Donaldson, to cover the escape of many men
of the Fort Donaldson army, whom we met scattered
all along the road. The weather was most
severe.</p>

<p>The winding up of this winter I had a sad
experience. About midnight, the second night out,
we pulled into a cedar grove by the side of the road,
the ground of which was soft and muddy. We tied
our horses to the trees around us, and arranged as
best we could, to get a little rest and sleep, putting
down our oilcloths next to the mud, then our saddle
blankets and each having a good blanket and overcoat
for cover. My messmate, John Cochran, laid
by me, and we soon dropped into a sound sleep,
being tired and worn out, and without having had
a bite of anything to eat that day and no forage for
our horses.</p>

<p>Waking up some time during the night, I felt
a curious feeling about my head. Putting my hand
to my head I found my hair clotted with blood. I
woke up Cochran, my companion, and told him that
some one had struck me over the head with a gun,
which proved a mistake. Our horses being tied in
the cold, without any feed, had pulled the length of
the rope and commenced pawing, when one of them
pawed me on the head with a sharp shoe, which
caused a deep cut of my scalp. We then decided
we would move through the woods until we could
strike some house, and soon struck a country road.
After traveling perhaps a mile, we discovered a
little log house by the side of the road and through
the cracks of the batten door, we saw a bright fire
burning on the inside. We knocked on the door,
which was answered by a very old gentleman, whom
we told that we wanted to come in and dress my
wounds. He asked who we were. We told him we
were Confederate soldiers, camped near there and
the cause of my hurt. He received us very kindly,
invited us into his main room, which contained a
double bed where his old wife was sleeping. As
soon as she saw my bloody condition, she jumped
up, dressed, heated some water and with nice clean
towels, commenced bathing my head and dressing
my wounds. She then went to work, put some clean
sheets and pillowcases on the bed and insisted on
our lying down and taking a good nap, while she
prepared breakfast for us.</p>

<p>While we told them that it was dangerous for
us to sleep in a bed, as we were not used to it and it
would give us a cold, we were compelled to take the
bed on their refusal to listen to anything else.</p>

<p>When we awoke next morning after daylight,
the old lady had a splendid breakfast of fried
chicken prepared for us, fine biscuit and good Confederate
coffee—made of rye and parched sweet
potatoes; everything on the table was neat and
spotlessly clean and I do not think we ever enjoyed
a meal during the whole war better than we
did this.</p>

<p>When we prepared to leave, we asked the old
gentleman for our bill; he seemed to feel hurt, and
said, “The idea of charging a Confederate soldier
for anything he had!” This was out of the question
with him; all he asked, if we ever happened in that
neighborhood, in twenty miles of him, to be sure
to make him another visit, for he hoped to meet us
again. Thanking them for their exceeding kindness,
we then walked back to camp, where we found
many of our comrades still in deep sleep, with no
forage for the horses.</p>

<p>In the course of a few hours the bugle called to
saddle up, and we resumed our march to Shelbyville,
and caught up with a good many of our retreating
infantry. Here we spent two days and had
our first taste of an attempt at discipline by Major
Harrison, who was then in command; Colonel Wharton
being sick somewhere on the line of our retreat.</p>

<p>It seems that Major Harrison met a couple of our
men in town without permission and ordered them
to return to camp immediately, which they refused
to do. When he returned to camp he ordered these
men arrested by the camp guards and placed on
the pike, marking time. A Mr. Sam Ash of Company
B (now still living in Houston) went to these
men and led them back to camp, telling them that
no such disgraceful punishment should be inaugurated
in the regiment. The infantry were passing
frequently and we considered it a disgrace to the
Texas Ranger to submit to such punishment. Major
Harrison finally yielded and passed the incident,
but to a great extent, lost the respect of the
command.</p>

<p>The army now continued its retreat through
Shelbyville, Huntsville, Decatur to Corinth, Mississippi,
without incidents of note, except the burning
of bridges behind us. We also destroyed the magnificent
bridge across the Tennessee River at Decatur.</p>

<p>It may be not out of place, before going further,
and to give the reader a better idea of the character
of the Texas Rangers, to mention an expression
of Hardee’s. While passing through Huntsville, Alabama,
some ladies, in company with General Hardee,
were standing on the sidewalk, watching us pass,
cheering and waving their handkerchiefs at us, when
one of them remarked to General Hardee, saying
“General, the Rangers are the best soldiers you
have; are they not?” He told them no, he was not
stuck on them, saying that they would not submit
to any discipline or drill; but he was willing to say
that in a battle, or when called on to meet a forlorn
hope, the Rangers always responded. General Hardee
was one of the strictest disciplinarians in our
army and wrote the military tactics that were used
by both sides.</p>

<p>We soon arrived at Corinth, where we were assigned
a camp ground about two miles from the
place, near a spring and we here witnessed new
additions to the main army. Occasionally scouting
parties from the regiment were sent out in different
directions towards the Tennessee River, which
duties were always performed to the satisfaction
of the commanding officers.</p>

<br/>
<span class='sc'>An Accidental Injury—Shiloh—The “Mark-time” Major.</span></h2></div>

<p>Our regiment, one night, was ordered out to
report at daylight to some point up the Tennessee
River, the night being very dark—one of the darkest
nights we ever traveled in—and branches and
small streams very boggy. Colonel Wharton, at
the head of the regiment, was riding a very fast
walking horse. We struck many places in these
branches where it was only possible for one horse
to cross at a time, and Wharton, as soon as across,
would strike out in his fast walk, leaving the rest
of his command to come on as best they could. This
threw the rear end of the regiment considerably
behind and we had to lope at full speed to catch
up with our file leaders after crossing these bad
places. In one of these races to catch up, my horse
stumbled and fell, pitching me over his head, with
my left arm extended, and I sustained a dislocation
of my left arm. Considerably stunned by the fall, and
suffering great pain from this dislocation, a comrade
was sent back with me to Corinth, where I had a
surgeon to replace my arm, with instructions to
carry it in a sling until it got well. Our regiment
returned the next night without having discovered
any of the enemy and was then ordered to prepare
three days’ rations, as was also the rest of the army.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the enemy had landed a large
force, under General Grant, at Pittsburg Landing.
Our regiment was ordered out with no one knowing
where they were going, until they moved in the
direction of Pittsburg Landing. They were immediately
followed by the whole army, and on the fifth
of April, they engaged the enemy and fought the
battle of Shiloh; our regiment was moved about on
the field from right to left. As the dense woods did
not afford an opportunity for mounted cavalry, they
were unable to do much fighting, except, about ten
o’clock the first day, they were dismounted and ordered
to charge through a thicket at Owl Creek,
which they had to do single file, and were shot down
by a large infantry force as fast as the men made
their appearance in the open. Soon realizing that
it was impossible to dislodge the enemy from their
position with this handful of men, they were immediately
ordered to fall back. This proved the extent
of their active engagement, but they served as a
corps of observation on both flanks until Tuesday
evening.</p>

<p>After the second day’s engagement, Grant’s army
having been reinforced on Sunday night by the
whole of Buell’s army (as large as our army originally),
our army was compelled to retreat, which
was done in a heavy rain, rendering the road to
Corinth almost impassable for artillery and ambulances.
Realizing that our army was in great danger
of being annihilated, General Beauregard sent
for General Breckenridge, who was on the field with
his Kentucky Brigade, ordering him to cover the
retreat and try to save the army. General Breckenridge
responded that he would protect the army if
it cost the last man he had. This occurred on Tuesday
after the battle. Our regiment, what was left of
it, and Colonel Forrest, with about fifty men, were
ordered to support General Breckenridge. Breckenridge’s
Brigade was drawn up near the old battlefield.
In their front, about a quarter of a mile away,
two lines of battle of the enemy were seen to form
with a brigade of cavalry, mounted, in their front,
covering their movement. Breckenridge’s Brigade
was then moved to the rear a short distance, to
a position where they were hid by lying down. Our
regiment, in command of Major Harrison, and
Colonel Forrest with his fifty men, soon formed
in front of Breckenridge, preparing to charge the
enemy.</p>

<p>As heretofore stated, Colonel Harrison, up to this
time, on our retreat, did not have the confidence or
respect of the men on account of a blunder he committed
at the small town of Jimtown in Kentucky,
which caused him to be dubbed the “Jimtown
Major;” then again, on account of his ordering some
boys to mark time on the Shelbyville Pike, was
dubbed the “Mark-time Major.”</p>

<p>A large number of the regiment had been congregated
on the pike, at the point from which Ash had
led the prisoners, and when Major Harrison reached
the spot, after hearing what had been done, he was
met by angry glances on every hand for presuming
to treat two gentlemen so inconsiderately. Disregarding
their menacing looks Major Harrison called
out, “Is there an officer of my regiment present
who will execute my orders?” when Pat Christian
(then a lieutenant in Company K) stepped to the
front, with a salute, and said, “Major, I will.” Then
Major Harris ordered him to get a file of men and
bring the two prisoners back to complete their sentence,
and to inform him instantly if interfered
with.</p>

<p>It was here that Christian, afterwards captain of
his company, and then major and later lieutenant
colonel, first attracted the attention of the regiment,
afterwards so devoted to him, for his gallantry and
his good traits of character, and here that the regiment
had its first lesson in military discipline, under
an officer temporarily unpopular, who afterwards
won their high respect.</p>

<p>For the first time since our retreat, he was in
command of the regiment, Colonel Wharton having
been wounded, and very soon the enemy commenced
a scattering fire, while the regiment was forming,
occasionally striking a man or a horse. The men
became restive and wanted to charge, but Major
Harrison rode down the line saying to them, “Be
quiet, boys, ‘till your ‘Jimtown Mark-time Major’
gets ready for you,” in a very cool and deliberate
manner, and finally in ordering the charge said,
“Now, follow your Jimtown Major.” He led them
on to the cavalry, which, in an impetuous charge,
they drove right in among their infantry, and, on
account of their being confused in the mix-up, the
enemy fell back a short distance, and the regiment
brought out a number of prisoners. While this
charge proved a success, we lost a number of valuable
men in killed and wounded. This was the last
fighting on the battlefield of Shiloh.</p>

<p>I have not entered into any details of the battle,
as history gives such a complete account, written
by both sides, that its details are well known, and
as the purpose of this writing is to recount my own
personal history and because I was not actively engaged
with the regiment during the battle, I find it
unnecessary to give the details.</p>

<p>As heretofore stated, I was suffering with a dislocated
arm, the effects of my fall, and did not move
out with the regiment when they started on this
trip; but on Sunday morning, hearing the guns of
Shiloh in our camp at Corinth, I mounted my horse
and struck out for the field. Unable to learn where
our regiment was posted, I remained with an infantry
command, offering my services to the extent
of what I was able to do, but I was not called on
during the several days’ battle, except to carry a
few orders from place to place.</p>

<p>I reached Corinth, Mississippi, where our camp
was located, on Thursday, aiding and assisting about
a half dozen wounded men of the Second Texas,
allowing them to ride my horse when they were able.
These men were completely exhausted, as they did
nothing else but stand in line all day Sunday ‘till
four o’clock in the evening, firing their guns, and
again on Monday, opposed to Buell’s fresh army,
which proved the hardest fighting during the battle.
“All honor to the Second Texas.”</p>

<p>Recalling General Albert Sidney Johnston’s
promise in a telegram to Colonel Terry at New Orleans,
that we should never be brigaded as long as
he lived; his death at four o’clock on Sunday evening
cancelled this promise. General Beauregard
then took command of the army.</p>

<p>A few days after the battle of Shiloh, having
recuperated our horses, as well as the men, Colonel
Wharton was ordered to report to a General Adams,
who had a Kentucky regiment, and General Adams,
with this regiment and the Eighth Texas, was ordered
on a raid into Middle Tennessee, with instructions
to capture and destroy everything of the
enemy he could meet up with and was able to handle.</p>

<p>We crossed the Tennessee River at Lamb’s Ferry,
the ferry boat being propelled by a paddle wheel,
driven by a horse-tread power. Here we left our
wagons and all our extra luggage, as well as cooking
utensils, awaiting our return, but the Federal cavalry
a few days after, crossed the river, captured our
entire storage and we never saw cooking utensils
or tents afterwards, and were thereby reduced to
the condition of the real Texas Ranger as on the
frontiers of Texas.</p>

<p>Immediately after crossing the Tennessee River
we struck a considerable infantry force, with artillery.
General Adams, in place of attacking them,
moved us around them in great haste, thereby avoiding
a collision and getting away, leaving them shelling
the woods for several hours, while we were making
distance. We next struck the Pulaski Pike,
finding about two hundred wagons, loaded with two
bales of cotton on each and a guard of two men
with each wagon. General Adams drew us out of
sight and hearing and would not allow Colonel
Wharton to capture this train, which could have
been done without the loss of a man. But no doubt
as General Adams suggested, in doing this we would
stir up a hornet’s nest and get the whole Yankee
army in pursuit of us. Wharton was powerless to
do anything, held back by General Adams.</p>

<p>When near the town of Fayetteville, Lincoln
County, Tennessee, a citizen sent out by the garrison
of the town, numbering about five hundred cavalry,
told us to come in; they wanted to surrender; they
were tired of the war and wanted to go home. General
Adams conceived this to be a trick of theirs and
declined their invitation, moving us around the town
in the night by a path in the woods, guided by a
citizen, thereby losing a splendid opportunity of capturing
this garrison.</p>

<p>The second night after this, we camped at the
town of Salem, about ten miles south of Winchester,
and at Winchester the next night, where information
reached us that about two thousand infantry,
moving in wagons, and a battery of artillery,
had been in pursuit of us and had been camped at
Salem the next night after we were there, and was
expected to follow us to Winchester. The road from
Salem to Winchester was a straight lane with high
rail fences on each side. At a point about equal
distance between Salem and Winchester, was a large
woods lot, running up to the lane, as noticed by
Colonel Wharton. He suggested to General Adams
that we go back, remain concealed in this woods,
close to the road and when the enemy came along,
riding in wagons, that we charge them and force
them to surrender. This seemed good to General
Adams and an opportunity he was willing to risk.</p>

<p>We moved around to this woods lot, remaining
there until about daylight, when information
reached us that the Yankees had already passed and
were then occupying Winchester. We immediately
returned to Winchester and found them drawn up
behind a railroad cut, with a commanding position
for their battery. They opened this battery on us,
using shells, as soon as we came in sight. Then
Colonel Wharton, riding ‘round hunting a place to
charge them, decided this could not be done without
the loss of a great many men and a charge
might result in failure; we, therefore, moved around
Winchester, passing through Decherd’s depot and
pitched camp in Hawkins Cove, perhaps twenty
miles distant from Winchester.</p>

<p>The second day in camp in Hawkins Cove, a
citizen came and reported to General Adams that
the Yankees were at his house with a couple of
wagons, loading his meat, and begging him to send
a small force to drive them away. A company of
the Kentucky regiment and Company B of the Rangers,
which was the company to which I belonged,
were detailed for this service. When we reached
this man’s house they had already left with his meat
and were driving fast, back into town. We struck
a lope, endeavoring to catch up with them, but
failed. The Kentucky captain, being the ranking
officer, was in command; riding at the head of the
column and running over the pickets on a bridge
near town, he carried us right into the town, up to
the courthouse square. This charge proved a complete
surprise. We found the enemy scattered all
over town and a large party of them in the courthouse,
being the only parties we felt free to fire on,
as there were no women and children about. We
heard the artillery bugle and concluded to get out
of there, which we did very promptly and in such
good time the artillery never had a chance to fire a
shot at us.</p>

<p>Some years after the war, a Winchester paper
was sent me, giving an account of fifty Texas
Rangers attacking two thousand infantry and artillery
in their town, with a loss of only one man,
who had his arm broken by an explosive ball.</p>

<p>We returned to our camp in Hawkins Cove. On
that night General Adams came down to Colonel
Wharton’s camp fire and announced that he would
start across the mountain, for Chattanooga, the next
morning, and secure artillery, that he could not
undertake to remain in Middle Tennessee without it.
Colonel Wharton had become exasperated at General
Adams’ conduct the entire trip and told him to
take his Kentucky regiment and go to Halifax with
it, if he wanted to—that he intended remaining in
Middle Tennessee and doing what he could to carry
out the original order of General Beauregard.</p>

<p>After a few days’ rest in Hawkins Cove, where
the enemy did not attempt to molest us, a messenger
reached us, with orders from General Kirby
Smith at Knoxville, to report to Colonel Forrest at
McMinnville, which Wharton did, as soon as we
reached there. After a day’s rest Colonel Forrest
(who had the First and Second Georgia and a Tennessee
battalion, all cavalry) in conjunction with
our regiment, started, late evening, for Murfreesboro,
which was then the headquarters for Tennessee,
of the Federal Army, with Major General Crittenden
in command. Murfreesboro’s garrison consisted
of the Ninth Michigan Infantry, a part of a regiment
of cavalry located in their camp to the right of
town, the Third Minnesota and a battery of artillery
on the northwest of town. They had about one
hundred prisoners in the courthouse, upstairs, with
a strong guard downstairs.</p>

<p>Greatly outnumbering us, our success depended
on a surprise. When near their advance picket on
the pike, Colonel Forrest asked for some Rangers to
capture this picket without the fire of a gun, which
was done in very short order. He then had a consultation
with the commanders of the different regiments,
and it was decided that Colonel Wharton,
with our regiment in advance and the Second Georgia
next in column, attack the Ninth Michigan and
the cavalry camp on the right. To reach them he had
to turn into a side street about two or three blocks
from the courthouse, where Colonel Forrest halted,
awaiting for his part of the command to come up
to take them through town to the Third Minnesota
and battery camp, ignoring the courthouse as much
as possible.</p>

<p>After our regiment had passed into the side
street, following Wharton, Forrest discovered that
the Georgians and Tennesseans had failed to come
up and immediately decided to take what was left
of our regiment and lead them to the attack on
the Third Minnesota and the battery north of the
town. This gave him a force of only about fifty
or sixty men. By this action he cut our company
about half in two, which threw me into the first
set of fours at the head of the column, with Forrest
riding by my side, on my right. Nearing the
courthouse, a couple of Federals up in the second
story door, dropped down on their knees and raised
their guns to fire, but Forrest and I fired ahead of
them. When Forrest fired his pistol, his horse dodged
almost in front of me, just as I fired, very nearly
shooting Forrest through the head. I have often
thought what a misfortune this would have been,
as I came very near killing a man who turned
out to be the Napoleon of cavalry.</p>

<p>In the upper story of the courthouse were confined
about one hundred prisoners, some of Morgan’s
men, but mostly civilians, and the courthouse
was guarded by about one hundred men, who fired
on us through doors and windows. We moved
around the courthouse, some to the left and some
to the right, as the courthouse was standing in the
middle of the square immediately fronting the center
of the street we came up on. About the time we
reached the courthouse, Wharton, with the balance
of the regiment, had charged the Michigan camp,
many of whom were asleep in their tents, and the
noise of the battle reached us about the time we fired
into the courthouse. As stated, Forrest with about
fifty men in columns of fours, except a few that
were left on the courthouse square, shot down by
courthouse guards, moved on to the north of town,
where he lost his bearings and was compelled to get
a citizen out of his house, to pilot us to the Minnesota
camp and battery. When we reached there we
found the men up and dressed and the battery opened
on us, throwing a few shells among us, which
scattered us and caused the disappearance of Forrest.
We were in an old field, and on leaving, I was
called by a Kentuckian, who had volunteered to go
with us into the fight and had his arm shattered by a
piece of shell, begging me to not go off and leave
him. He was hardly able to sit on his horse. I
rode up, taking his horse by the bridle, leading him
up to a fence in the edge of the timber, with a scattering
fire directed on us. I dismounted and let
down the fence, leading his horse over it. While
doing this, noticing I was trying to get off a
wounded comrade, they gallantly ceased firing on
us. I now led my wounded friend through the
woods, until we reached a house, about a mile from
there, when the gentleman at the house hitched
up his buggy, and, placing my friend in the buggy,
he drove around the town, with myself following,
leading the wounded man’s horse, until we reached
a point about a mile below town, where we found
the Rangers collecting what was left of them, out
of the Michigan camp fight and also the few men
who were with Forrest in the old sedge field when
fired on by the Third Minnesota and battery.</p>

<p>The regiment formed and gathered at this point
about a mile below town, awaiting further orders,
with Wharton, wounded again, directing the formation,
when a messenger came from Forrest, who
was then up town with his Georgia and Tennessee
battalions, ordering us back up into town. After
joining the Georgians and having displayed about
three times as many men as he really had, by moving
them around a block, in sight of the enemy (who
had gathered and formed, in a splendid position,
supported by their battery) Forrest went in, under
a flag of truce and demanded their immediate surrender,
telling them that he had five men to their
one and was determined to take them; that if he
had to make another charge on them, on their own
heads be the responsibility; that the little fight
had, was only with his advance guard, that he had
five hundred Texas Rangers he couldn’t control in a
fight, and the responsibility was with them. After
deliberating on the matter for a few minutes, they
raised the white flag and surrendered. The result
of this surrender was a parole of eighteen hundred
and sixteen privates at McMinnville, the further
capture of forty-seven commissioned officers, including
Major General Crittenden, with Colonel Duffield
of the Ninth Michigan badly wounded in the Michigan
camp; thirty-eight wagonloads of valuable
stores; a magnificent battery of four pieces of artillery
and several million dollars’ worth of commissary
and quartermaster’s stores, destroyed by
fire.</p>

<p>I would also mention the release of two citizen
prisoners confined in the jail, who were condemned
to be hung the next day, as spies. The wife of one
of these men, with many other ladies, witnessed our
passing through Woodbury. Learning that we were
going to Murfreesboro, she wrung her hands and
begged and plead with us to bring her husband back.
Some of the men who heard her, answered that we
would surely bring her husband back, which we
did the next day.</p>

<p>A dastardly act I will recount here—of one of
the Federal guards stationed at the jail. When he
found we were about to capture the town, he set
fire to the jail, which no doubt would have burned
the poor prisoners, but the fire was promptly extinguished
by several of our men, who succeeded in
capturing the fellow who started the fire and in
taking him before General Forrest. Forrest pulled
out his pistol and killed him on the spot, a well-deserved
punishment.</p>

<p>On marching our prisoners to McMinnville, the
commissioned officers who had been captured, were
given the privilege of the pike, they taking a parole
not to attempt to make their escape. When this
high privilege was offered Major General Crittenden,
he refused the courtesy, telling Forrest that
he could not accept, as his government didn’t recognize
him as a regular Confederate soldier and
only knew him as a guerilla. Forrest told him that
it made no difference with him and he furnished
him with a guard of two Texas Rangers, dressed in
buckskin, wearing Mexican sombreros. These men
were somewhat wild in appearance, no doubt, to
General Crittenden. After riding along with his
guards for an hour or two, one man on each side of
him, occasionally nodding at each other, the general
concluded that perhaps they were planning
to kill him, and had them take him up to Colonel
Forrest, when he asked Forrest to parole him and
give him the privilege of the pike, like the rest; saying
he verily believed that these men would kill him.</p>

<p>After paroling the privates at McMinnville, permitting
them all to retain their private property,
which included a magnificent set of silver band instruments,
Forrest told the officers that they would
have to be taken to Knoxville to General Smith’s
headquarters and directed Colonel Wharton, who
was wounded, with Company B, his old company,
to take charge of them, the battery and thirty-eight
wagonloads of valuable stores. He requested Colonel
Wharton, when he got safely up on top of the
mountain, by way of Sparta, to send back a messenger,
reporting that fact, and I was sent back with
this message to Colonel Forrest.</p>

<p>Reaching Sparta about daylight, I could not find
any one who could tell me the whereabouts of Forrest’s
command, and struck out, back in the direction
of McMinnville, when incidentally I met a citizen,
who reported that they were camped at a certain
place in the woods between Sparta and Lebanon,
which I succeeded in finding about noon. Reporting
to Colonel Forrest that Wharton had got up on top
of the mountain safely with his prisoners, artillery
and wagons, I told him that I didn’t feel like going
back to catch up with my company, going to Knoxville,
lying around in camp and that I wanted to
remain with the regiment and asked his permission
to do so. He kindly consented and told me to report
to the regiment and stay with them.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span><h2>CHAPTER VII<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>I Am Wounded and Captured.</span></h2></div>

<p>The Rangers now felt that they were commanded
by somebody who meant business and that there
was plenty of work in store for them. After remaining
in this camp another day, we started for Lebanon,
in the night, where it was understood a considerable
cavalry force of the enemy were camped.
Reaching the town about daylight, we formed fours
and charged in, being greeted by ladies, through
their windows, waving handkerchiefs and cheering,
with no Federal cavalry in town, they having moved
to Murfreesboro during the night, in great haste,
learning we were on the way.</p>

<p>Here at Lebanon, we found, as in nearly every
town we had been in in Middle Tennessee, a strong
Southern people, who, while we were camped there
for two days, gave us a great feast of everything
that was good, which was heartily enjoyed by the
whole command. Forrest, on being interviewed as to
what was next on docket, said that he was going to
take Nashville, though strongly fortified, and garrisoned
by an infantry force of not less than ten
thousand men under General Nelson.</p>

<p>On the early morning of the third day, we started
out on the main Nashville pike, moving along at an
ordinary gait, occasionally meeting citizens, out
from Nashville, saying there was great excitement
among the Yankees, and they were digging additional
pits and preparing a strong defense. When
we reached within twelve miles of Nashville, we
struck a road leading through the cedars, to La Vergne,
a station between Murfreesboro and Nashville.
Before reaching La Vergne, General Forrest
detailed about two hundred Rangers, under Captain
Ferrell, to meet and capture a train from Murfreesboro,
at La Vergne, which they succeeded in
doing, capturing a large number of commissioned
officers, who were on their way home on furlough,
and capturing also the mails and express freight.
Among these prisoners I will mention the kind-hearted
and excellent business man among us today,
a Mr. Fordyce, of the Pierce-Fordyce Oil Association,
one of the largest oil concerns doing business
in Texas.</p>

<p>Forrest, with the balance of the command, went
to work tearing up the railroad between La Vergne
and Nashville, burning trestles and bridges and tearing
up the track. We then again retired to McMinnville.
Before leaving in front of Nashville, Colonel
Forrest asked for a detail of about fifteen or twenty
men, who were selected from the Rangers and
joined by four or five of Morgan’s men, who happened
to be along. I was one of this party, and
we were all under the command of a Captain Gordon,
who proved to be a reckless fellow, unfit to command
such a party successfully. We crossed Cumberland
River near Lebanon, in a bend called Little
Dixie. Little Dixie was settled with some of
the strongest Southern and most liberal people in
the State, and regarded as a safe haven for the
wounded Confederate soldiers, whom these good
people would nourish and care for, to the extent of
any character of risk. While crossing there, we
promised the ladies if any of us were wounded, we
would not fail to make our way back, so they could
take care of us until able to join our command. Our
orders from Colonel Forrest for the expedition were
to collect information on the disposition of the Federal
forces, preparatory to a general raid of our
cavalry.</p>

<p>After crossing the river, we moved up towards
the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad, circulating
through that section quite extensively, gathering information,
and, on our return, we decided to capture
a railroad train, with the mails from the army,
which always proved very valuable, as the soldiers
were always writing home on the movements
of their army, which proved most valuable information
for our headquarters.</p>

<p>In accordance with our plans, we struck the
Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad between Woodburn
and Franklin, at a point about equidistant between
the two places; watering our horses at a branch
within hearing of a Union man’s house, who was
awakened and decided that we had about three
hundred men, supposing us to be of Morgan’s command.
Riding around in the branch, as we did,
led him to the conclusion that we had about three
hundred men. We struck the railroad about daylight,
when we removed a few spikes, spreading the
track, for the purpose of stopping the train and,
being in a thick woods out of hearing, with no settlement
near, we all laid down for a short nap.
The mail train from the army was due at this point
about eleven-thirty; another mail train from above
was due about twelve o’clock, with numerous
freight trains, carrying troops and war material,
due throughout the day, also trains returning with
wounded and discharged soldiers.</p>

<p>We heard the mail train whistle, from below,
when it reached Franklin, and nothing of any other
train, waiting until between three and four o’clock
in the evening. I became satisfied that we were
going to be caught in a trap and so told Gordon,
insisting on leaving there, but Gordon refused to
listen; he had just about sense enough to lose what
he had. Finally, between three and four o’clock
we heard the train, and immediately took position
by the side of the track, having nineteen men for
the fight, two of the men remaining with our horses,
in the rear. All that could get trees for shelter,
within twenty feet of the track took position behind
trees, while eight of us, unable to find trees convenient,
laid down flat on the ground. Very soon
the train came up, turning a bend in the road about
a half mile below us. The engineer, to fool us, put
on more steam, making us think that they were entirely
ignorant of our presence, and stopped right
at the place we had shifted the rail. Soon they
were right on us and began firing with about three
hundred muskets, killing seven of our party, who
were lying on the ground and jumped up, and badly
wounding me, but the balance of our party, eleven
strong, behind trees, with six-shooters, drove those
fellows off the train on to the other side of the
track. There the commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel
(Blank), succeeded in forming about a
hundred men in line in about twenty minutes, so
he stated to me at the hospital at Bowling Green,
where he made me a visit about a week after, furthermore
stating that he believed if we had had about
twenty-five more men we would have gotten his
train. It seems that this was the first time these people
were ever under fire and when under the impression
that we had three hundred of Morgan’s men,
they were no doubt demoralized at the noise of their
own guns.</p>

<p>The citizen at whose house we watered our horses
at the branch had spied out our exact location on the
railroad, a desolate place, where Morgan’s cavalry
had captured a train before. He went to Franklin,
where he met the train from the army, reported
three hundred of Morgan’s men, when they ran
the train back to Gallatin, Tennessee, unloaded the
mails and express freight and took this regiment
aboard, also notifying other trains that we were
on the road, which caused their delay.</p>

<p>While the Federals were jumping off the train
on the other side, we fell back to our horses, mounting,
leaving the horses belonging to the men that
were killed; not knowing at the time just who was
left behind. I was able to run back and mount my
own horse, with the assistance of a comrade. We
hurried out of there, taking the road by which we
had come, by this Union man’s house, where I
stopped to get me a drink of water. I had just
been relieved of my pistol belt, and had grown very
weak and faint from the loss of blood, which had
collected in my boots, and was about to fall from
the horse when I was caught by a comrade. Some
one called out, “Here they come!” This aroused
me. I made them hand me my pistols. We drew
up in line in the lane and saw a party in the edge
of the timber. Drawing our pistols we waved them
at them and urged them to come on, which they
didn’t do. We soon discovered that they were
only parties from the train who had found our dead
men’s horses and were afraid to come forward.</p>

<p>We now continued our march on this country
road about eight or ten miles. I became too weak
to travel and, satisfied that being encumbered with
me would cause them all to get captured or killed,
I insisted on their leaving me, believing that I was
done for, anyway.</p>

<p>We soon reached a Mr. White’s (an humble log
house) who had two sons in Breckenridge’s Brigade,
and had with him his wife and daughter. He was
an ardent Southern man and promised my comrades
that I should have every attention, if left with them.
Before leaving, I begged them to let me keep my
pistols, which they failed to do, thinking it was best
to leave me disarmed, as it proved to be.</p>

<p>My comrades then proceeded in haste to get out
of that neighborhood and made for the Cumberland
River, our main army then being near Chattanooga.
In about an hour a citizen doctor came to see me and
filled my wound full of cotton, in order to check the
bleeding, saying that this was all that he could
do for me; he had to hurry back home, lest he was
caught giving me his attention, believing his neighbors
would hang him and burn his family out of
house and home, as this section of the country was
inhabited by a desperate, vindictive Union people.</p>

<p>During the evening a young man called and
claimed to be a good Rebel, saying that he had an
uncle, who was also a good friend of the South,
living up in the mountains, and if he could succeed
in taking me there, that I would be perfectly safe.
He arranged with me to come that night, with a
hack, and take me to his uncle’s, which he failed
to do.</p>

<p>Mr. White’s house was a double log house, a room
at each end, with about a ten-foot hall in between,
but no porch in front, a step at each room, leading
out into the yard and heavy batten doors covering
the door opening. Old Mr. White occupied a bed
in the room with me, while his wife and daughter
occupied a room at the other end. They had improvised
a cot for me, in the middle of the room,
so they could get around it. They used wick and
tallow lamps for lights, which created a bad smell
in the room and annoyed me a great deal, as I had
considerable fever. Some time after midnight I
begged the old man to extinguish his lamp, and
very soon thereafter, I heard voices in the yard and
immediately a pounding on the door with the butt
end of a gun. The reader can imagine my feelings; I
was satisfied they were Tories and my time had
come. I would then have given a kingdom for
my pistols and, no doubt, would have opened on
them as they came in. They called and demanded
of the old man to open the door quick. He told
them to wait until he could strike a light, which
he did. I was in position, from where I lay, to
notice them coming in and to my great relief, saw
a lieutenant and ten men in uniform, passing around
me. Here was one time I was glad to see the Federal
uniform. When they got up to my bunk, I feigned
sleep and listened to what they had to say. The
lieutenant asked the old man if I was badly hurt.
He told him to turn down the sheet and he could
judge for himself, when the lieutenant expressed
his surprise and said, “I’m afraid we won’t be able
to move him.” Now I concluded it was my time
to say something. I opened my eyes and feigned
bewilderment, looking up at them. The lieutenant
asked, “Are you hurt much, sir?” I told them no,
I did not think I was, and couldn’t understand why
I had been left there. The lieutenant asked if I
thought that I could stand to be hauled to Woodburn,
a station about five miles from there and the
first station this side of Bowling Green. I told him
I was satisfied I could stand it all right. He then
ordered the old gentleman to direct him where he
could find feed for his horses, also to have breakfast
for his men by daylight and have his own team
and wagon ready to haul me to their camp at a
church about four miles from there, where the balance
of his regiment, the Eleventh Kentucky
Mounted Infantry, were camped.</p>

<p>About daylight they started for their camp, with
me lying on a mattress in the wagon. We reached
camp in due time. The lieutenant-colonel commanding
the regiment, which had been started in
pursuit of our party, then stood up on the wagon
wheel and questioned me as to where the balance of
our party had gone. I told him they had gone up
on the railroad towards Louisville, where they expected
to capture a train before they returned to
the army, thus directing him off their trail, as
they were making great haste to cross the Cumberland
River and were avoiding pursuit.</p>

<p>When this officer called to see me at the hospital
at Bowling Green, he referred to my throwing
him off my comrades’ trail, saying that he couldn’t
account for accepting my statement, as he did, but
“you seemed so honest in your statement, that I believed
you, and committed one of the greatest blunders
I was ever guilty of.”</p>

<p>After questioning me at this camp, he sent a
sergeant and two men, with a wagon, to haul me
to Woodburn, the first station, where I was lifted
into a boxcar on a train for Bowling Green.</p>

<p>Arriving at Bowling Green I was taken up to
General Judah’s headquarters, laid down on the
floor of his room, surrounded by some soldiers, and
he questioned me on the number of our party, what
command we belonged to; he also asked if we had
ever been engaged in that kind of warfare before.
I told him that it had been the business of our regiment
to destroy their line of communication, capture
trains and everything else we were able to do
to annoy the enemy, when he said, “Young man,
you will never fire into another train.” I told
him that I expected to fire into many an one, that
this little scratch would soon get well and I would
be ready for service again. He said, “Young man,
we’ve got a rope for all such fellows as you.” I
told him there was a higher authority than he,
that would have my disposition. He said, “Who?”
I told him, “President Davis.” He laughed and
said, “Jeff Davis has no authority here.” I told
him that I hoped it wouldn’t be long before he would
have. Feeling very irritable, with a hot fever on
me, I was able to resent his threat in the manner I
did and felt able to talk to him, although an officer
of a high rank, in resentment of his threat.</p>

<p>I was then taken to their regular hospital, located
on Barren River, about a mile and a half from
town, where I was very kindly received by the
surgeon in charge, who turned out to be a very sympathetic,
kind-hearted man. I was furnished a cot,
the same as their other sick, in the principal ward,
and had a guard detailed to stay with me all the
time. This guard consisted of two men, who were
on duty every alternate six hours.</p>

<p>Under the care of this doctor and good nurses,
I soon began to recover my strength and began to
hope that I would be permitted to stay there until
able to travel on foot, having no doubt I could make
my escape out of there, when ready.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Rebel ladies of Bowling Green,
learning there was a wounded Texas Ranger at the
hospital, would get permission from the provost
marshal to visit the sick, he supposing that they
meant the Federal sick. When admitted to the
wards they would come directly to my cot and deposit
flowers, fruit and cake, and encourage me in
the belief that I would soon get well again.</p>

<p>My generous, kind-hearted surgeon would sometimes
send and get fish or oysters for me, evidently
in the belief that he was doing a last kind act for
me, as he expected me to be court martialed and
sentenced to death, having frankly told me so, trying
to persuade me to take the oath, which I refused
to do.</p>

<p>As soon as I was able to sit up and talk without
effort and overtaxing my strength, we had several
discussions about the conduct of the war and the
merits of the two armies. On one occasion I said to
him, “I’m going to make an assertion, Doctor, and
before I make it, I want to qualify it by stating that
you have many good, patriotic men in your army
and you are one of them; but, taking your
army as a whole, they are an army of hirelings,
fighting for their bounties and their pay, and would
not hold together thirty days if their pay was
stopped.” He spurned the idea, telling me that I
was sadly mistaken, while there might be a few men
that could be classed as hirelings, the bulk of their
army were prompted only by patriotic motives and
were not considering gain or pay. I said, “Doctor,
I will prove my assertion right here in your presence,”
and called up some convalescents. Addressing
one, I asked him, “What induced you to join
the army and what are you fighting for?” He
said, “I am fighting for the flag and the Union,”
but I said, “As a matter of fact, were you not paid
a bounty?” He admitted that he had been paid
six hundred dollars by his State. Then again,
“What pay do you receive?” He said, “Twelve
dollars per month.” “What do you do with your
money?” He said, “I send it home, for safety.”
“Why don’t you spend it?” “I have nothing to
spend it for.” “Does your Government furnish
you everything you need?” “Everything,” he said.
I interrogated a second one, whose answers were
about the same. I then detailed the treatment our
Government had been forced to accord our army,
who were frequently without pay, often without
rations or clothing, especially without shoes, sometimes
forced them to go barefooted, leaving their
bloody tracks on the road. “Now, boys, if your
Government treated you in such manner, what would
you do?” They replied, “We wouldn’t fight for
any such d—— Government; we would go home and
stay there.” I said to the doctor, “Withdraw your
pay and rations from your army and you wouldn’t
hold them together for sixty days,” on which point
we could not agree and he said, “Graber, you are
too good a man to be engaged in such a cause.” I
replied, “Doctor, that is just my opinion of you;
you ought to wear the gray in place of the blue,” all
of which he took in the kindliest spirit. I frequently
conversed with the ward master and some of the
nurses, who seemed to have taken a great fancy for
me on account of my bold, outspoken sentiments,
and they sympathized with me in my helpless condition.</p>

<p>I had concluded to try to make my escape as soon
as I got strong enough to undertake walking
through the woods, over a rough country across the
river. There were always a number of boats tied
to the river bank. I would have had no difficulty
in crossing Barren River. One night a guard on
duty with me was sound asleep, snoring, with his
head resting on the foot of my cot and I was wide
awake. The nurse on duty went over to the ward
master’s bed, not far from my cot, and woke him
up. He aroused himself, and the nurse in a low
voice told him, “The guard is asleep; let us tell
Texas to get away.” The ward master said, “No,
don’t do that; you had better wake up the guard,”
which he did. A little pleading on my part then
would, no doubt, have had their consent, but I was
still too feeble to undertake the hazard.</p>

<p>After spending about a month at this hospital,
the provost marshal had heard of the ladies abusing
his confidence and calling at my berth only, and
rarely ever having a kind word for the Federal sick,
so he had me moved to the prison, where I found
about twenty-five or thirty men confined, most of
them Morgan’s men and a few highway robbers,
who sought the protection of the Confederate Government
by claiming to belong to certain Confederate
commands, which I was satisfied was not the
case. Kentucky afforded a good territory for these
highwaymen to operate, on account of this condition.</p>

<p>Arriving at this prison proved the commencement
of my suffering and trouble, as the surgeon
in charge was a brute. He came in and threw some
soap and bandages at my feet and I never saw him
any more.</p>

<p>The prison was a two-story stone building with
a brick gable, with the side fronting the street; it
had been a two-story residence, converted into a
jail by attaching iron gratings in the large windows;
it had only four rooms, two upstairs, occupied by
the prisoners, and two downstairs, occupied by
about twenty guards on active duty. There was
also a room for the lieutenant commanding. There
was a stairway, leading down into one of the rooms
below, with a door at the foot of the steps. About
two companies of infantry camped in the back yard,
which was surrounded by a high board fence, and
there was a sink in the back end of the yard. These
troops were quartered in tents. The building was
located diagonally across the street from a big hotel,
which was occupied by the commanding officers, as
headquarters.</p>

<p>Here I made the acquaintance of a Lieutenant
Clark of Morgan’s command, whose home was Bowling
Green, where he was teaching before the war.
Lieutenant Clark was a brother-in-law of Captain
Tom Hines, one of Morgan’s trusted lieutenants and
the man that planned Morgan’s escape out of the
Ohio penitentiary. Lieutenant Clark and I were both
held under the same charges for court martial,
Morgan’s command raiding Kentucky, destroying
their line of communications and Forrest in charge
of Middle Tennessee; it is hardly necessary to say
that we became fast friends and plotted and planned
escape, the only chance for which was frustrated.</p>

<p>Colonel Clarence Prentice, in conjunction with
Major Kit Ousley, also of Morgan’s command, was
sent into Kentucky by our War Department to recruit
a regiment for the Confederate Army.</p>

<p>Colonel Clarence Prentice was the son of the
publisher of the Louisville Courier, which was
largely responsible for retaining Kentucky in the
Union. The family were divided in sentiment; the
father was a great Union man and particular friend
of Abraham Lincoln, while Mrs. Prentice and the
two sons were strongly Southern in sentiment, the
sons joining the Confederate Army.</p>

<p>Colonel Prentice, immediately on his arrival at
his home, was captured and through the influence of
his father, was sent around for exchange. Major
Kit Ousley was captured near Bowling Green, in
citizen’s clothes, therefore treated as a spy and
placed in prison with us, awaiting court martial.
When Ousley was captured they found a letter on
his person from Fountain Fox, whose home was in
Elizabethtown, this letter stating that Fox had succeeded
in raising a company of one hundred and
four of the best young men of his neighborhood,
ready to move at a moment’s warning. They immediately
sent up and arrested Fountain Fox and
placed him in prison with us.</p>

<p>Fountain Fox’s father also was an influential
Union man, and the Fox family was divided like
the Prentice family, Mrs. Fox and sons strong Southern
sympathizers, and Mr. Fox a personal friend
of Abraham Lincoln. When Lincoln commenced
making his appointments abroad, he appointed
Fountain Fox, Consul to Madrid, Spain. Consulting
with his mother about the appointment, she advised
him not to accept, telling him he would see
the time very soon when he would blush to represent
the American Government abroad. Taking his
mother’s advice, he declined the appointment.</p>

<p>After a short time, to appease his father’s anger,
he accepted a captaincy in the Home Guards, in
which capacity he served about a year. On the reorganization
of the regiment, he was appointed
major, serving in this capacity about three or four
months longer, when they were ordered to Franklin,
Tennessee, to the front. He said, “Considering that
all of his youth’s companions and nearly all of his
schoolmates were in the Southern army, he could not
go down there and fight them” and made haste to
resign.</p>

<p>Some sixty days after his resignation he met
Major Ousley some distance from Elizabethtown,
out in the country. Being well acquainted with him
Ousley gave Fox a commission to raise a company
for the Confederate Army, and he soon wrote Ousley
the letter that was found on Ousley’s person
when he was captured, and which caused Fox’s
arrest.</p>

<p>His father immediately went to see the President
and secured an order for his release, provided
he would take the oath of allegiance to the United
States and remain north of the Mason and Dixon’s
line during the war, also giving a bond of fifty thousand
dollars, all of which he did, remaining in prison
with us perhaps only two or three weeks. This
prison was directly in charge of Major Erastus Motley,
provost marshal, an old friend of Clark’s before
the war and a schoolmate of Captain Hines.
He, like many Kentucky officers in such position,
had made himself very obnoxious by his tyrannical
treatment of the families of Confederate soldiers
and seemed greatly prejudiced against Clark and
myself.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span><h2>CHAPTER VIII<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>The Escape of Major Ousley.</span></h2></div>

<p>A court martial to try Major Kit Ousley was
soon organized and his trial resulted easily in conviction,
as he occupied the position of a spy, being
captured in citizen’s clothes. Very soon his sentence
was returned from General Burnside, and approved
by him, General Burnside being in command
of Kentucky and Ohio, with his headquarters
at Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Major Ousley, while recruiting up in the Blue
Grass region near Lexington, married a very
wealthy and beautiful young lady, who as soon as
she heard of his capture and imprisonment at Bowling
Green, came down to render what assistance she
could, and succeeded in bribing a lieutenant, who
had an office in town, paying him eight thousand
dollars for his assistance. This officer kept her
posted and gave her the information about the
return that evening of the verdict of the court martial,
approved by General Burnside, which was his
conviction as a spy and his punishment death by
hanging. He was to be placed over in the courthouse
in irons under a special guard until the day
of his execution, which was fixed for the 29th of
May, while this information was imparted on the
14th of May.</p>

<p>Major Ousley asked permission that evening to
go to a barber shop, which permission was granted
by sending a special guard with him. At this barber
shop he met his wife, who succeeded in obtaining a
private interview with him, when she imparted the
information about having bribed this lieutenant and
the location of his office, which Ousley understood,
as he was well acquainted in Bowling Green. She
had also received from the lieutenant a pair of surgeon’s
shoulder straps and the password for that
night, which was “Columbia,” and which was imparted
to Lieutenant Clark and myself by Ousley,
after he returned to the prison.</p>

<p>Major Ousley had a visit that evening from
several officers of the court martial, who seemed
to be old acquaintances of his and had quite a long
chat with them, with a good deal of levity, which
of course was a matter of surprise to Clark and
myself, as he seemed to be completely at ease. Considering
his condition with his doom already sealed,
we thought he displayed more nerve than any man
we ever saw.</p>

<p>Major Ousley requested his officer friends, before
they left him, to send him a bottle of brandy,
which they did and which he distributed freely
among the guards on duty in the lower room, hoping
to load them up, and in doing this we were afraid
he imbibed a little too much himself.</p>

<p>Now, it was imperative for him to make his
escape that night, for, as stated, he was to be placed
in irons the next day and kept in the courthouse
under special guard. With Clark and myself, and
other trusted friends in the prison, we planned that
the only means of his escape would be to cut a
hole through the plastering overhead large enough
to admit a man into the attic; then take a sufficient
number of brick out of the gable end which connected
with the roof of a single-story house adjoining,
all of which was done by the willing hands of
our comrades; but a mistake was made in the location
of the hole through the brick wall. This hole
opened on top of a roof, on the side facing the
street in full view of the headquarters on the other
side. Major Ousley imparted the countersign to
Clark and myself with an injunction and earnest request
not to attempt to get out until after giving
him four hours the start, as his case was the most
desperate one and we had not been tried by the
court martial. This promise we fully kept.</p>

<p>When Major Ousley passed through the hole in
the brick wall on to the roof of the other house, it
was drizzling rain and the night was very dark, so
the hole could not be discovered on the other side of
the street. He laid flat on the roof for a few minutes,
then quietly crawled over the comb of the house,
on the other side, out of sight of the street, then
to the far end of the roof away from the prison and
dropped down into the yard of a private residence
when a large dog got after him, giving one bark
and no more. Ousley told me afterwards that he
hit this dog with his fist and said, “I reckon I killed
him!” Some of the guards in our prison yard
rushed to the fence and asked a lady who came to
the door, what was the matter; she said, “Nothing
that I know of, everything is all right over here,”
which seemed to quiet their suspicion, so they went
back to their tents. Major Ousley soon was heard
to come down the walk in front of our prison. He
was halted by the guard, asking, “Who comes
there?” “A friend with the countersign.” “Advance,
friend, and give the countersign.” He gave
the countersign and passed on down the street and
found the lieutenant’s room. The lieutenant told
him it would not be safe for him to attempt to go
out that night, but to go down into the river bottoms,
stay there all next day, then return to his office,
when he would have a horse and side arms for him
and give him the new countersign for that night.
Ousley went down to the river bottoms and spent
the day until very near night. Then, being very
hungry, he decided to go to a friend’s house, who
lived away out in the suburbs and get something
to eat. Just before reaching his friend’s house, he
struck the big road and immediately heard the running
of a horse behind him, which proved to be a
man on horseback loping towards town. Though
he did not suspect any such thing, the man evidently
went to town and raised the alarm. On entering the
house his friend’s wife met him. She was well acquainted
with Ousley, but her husband was not at
home, and she, of course, was surprised and alarmed,
as she knew that he was a prisoner. When he made
known his wants, she rushed in and prepared a
lunch, while he stood at the front door, watching.
As soon as the lunch was ready, she invited him into
the diningroom and took his place watching. Before
he finished his lunch she rushed into the diningroom,
saying, “My God, Major Ousley, you are lost,
you are lost.” He told her to keep perfectly quiet.
“The safest place is among the enemy,” he said,
and grabbed a couple of biscuits, stuck them into
his coat pocket, and started out of the front door
when a couple of guards behind a rosebush, jumped
up, threw their guns down on him and told him to
halt. He cursed them and told them to get behind
that bush. Major Ousley would see them, making
them believe that he was one of their own officers.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that he had the surgeon’s
shoulder straps sewed on to his coat at the shoulders,
the same as was the custom in the Federal
Army. As already stated, when captured, he had
on a splendid double-breasted frock coat and black
pants, all of which in the dark could easily be
mistaken for a Federal uniform, hence on the spur
of the moment, he made the two guards believe
that he was one of their own officers. He walked
to the gate and passing outside, walked very fast
up the fence, and when about a hundred yards
these men began to call, “Halt,” when he broke
into a run and left them firing after him, not receiving
a scratch. While, of course, they ran after
him I imagine they didn’t try very hard to catch
him, fearing perhaps that he had accomplices, prepared
to defend him.</p>

<p>Major Ousley next circled around the town and
again made his way to the lieutenant’s room, who
had a horse ready for him, gave him a couple of
six-shooters and the countersign for that night. He
boldly rode down the main street leading to Barren
River bridge, where he gave the countersign
to the guards, then up the pike towards Louisville.</p>

<p>After an all-night’s ride he pulled up at a
friend’s house, where he decided to stay until Morgan’s
command came in there and go with them
back to our main army, telling his friend his purpose.
His friend said, “Major, you can’t stay here;
there is a brigade of Yankees camped at a spring
about a mile from here and Colonel Gross, the
commander, comes over occasionally and has a game
of poker with me.” Ousley told him that would not
make any difference, he was going to stay anyway
and take a hand with him at poker. He then proceeded
to disguise; cut off a heavy mustache, and
also cut his hair short, which made him look like
a different man; and he actually stayed at this
friend’s house for nearly three weeks, joining his
friend and Colonel Gross in several games of poker.
He finally heard of Morgan’s command in the blue
grass region, mounted his horse to try to find them
and telling his friend good-bye and to give him
a half hour’s start, and then to tell Colonel Gross
who he was and tell him the next time they met
pistols would be trumps. His friend said that he
wouldn’t do such a thing for anything in the world;
he said, “Colonel Gross never will find out through
me or mine who you were.”</p>

<p>Major Ousley succeeded in finding Morgan’s
command and went out of the State with them, reporting
to the War Department at Richmond, and
was given a job in the department and an order
forbidding him to re-enter the army. I met him
again at Richmond, where he detailed all of the features
and incidents of his escape from the time he
dropped into the adjoining yard and knocked over
the dog.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span><h2>CHAPTER IX<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>In Prison at Louisville, Where I Was Honored With Handcuffs.</span></h2></div>

<p>Referring to Bowling Green prison, where
Major Ousley had left us: Four hours after Ousley’s
escape, our friends in the prison boosted
Clark and me up into the attic, when we found out
to our dismay that the weather had cleared and the
moon had risen sufficiently high to light up the front
of our building, disclosing the hole in the gable.
The general’s headquarters being diagonally across
the street with a guard’s beat immediately in
front, I whispered to Clark, “We had better wait
until the corporal comes with his relief guard in
front of the headquarters and watch their actions.”
Waiting about thirty minutes, a corporal with a
relief appeared on the beat and the three stood for
some time talking and looking up at our prison wall,
which satisfied us that they had made the discovery
of the hole and were only waiting for some of us
to crawl out on the roof, when they would have
shot us. We, therefore, decided it would be folly to
attempt our escape that night, which proved a wise
decision.</p>

<p>The next morning at roll call the discovery was
made that Major Ousley was missing, which caused
the greatest excitement; and immediately scouting
parties of eight or ten men dashed up to the headquarters
across the street for orders, and started
out in a lope. All that day these parties called for
orders and came back and reported at headquarters.
Major Motley came up and saw the manner of Ousley’s
escape, and asked the prisoners who made
those holes and assisted Ousley. None of us vouchsafed
any information. He then sent for the most
desperate prisoners, some that were not Confederates,
as heretofore stated, and told them that their
cases were bad, but if they would tell who assisted
Ousley in making his escape, and tried to make their
escape with him, he would do all he could to let
them off as easy as possible. This we learned
through two most excellent citizens, who were in the
prison with us, and who were also taken out and
offered their liberty if they would disclose Ousley’s
accomplices. One of these was a Colonel Lewis, living
near Franklin; the other a Doctor Vertriece, a neighbor
of Colonel Lewis. These men were imprisoned
because of our raid on the railroad, which the reader
will remember occurred between Franklin and
Woodburn. It was the custom of the Federal commander,
whenever Morgan, or any other troops,
made a raid on the railroad, to arrest the most
prominent citizens in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>After several days of questioning these prisoners,
Major Motley came up; my friend Clark was
asleep on a mattress the lieutenant of the guard
had favored me with, on account of my being
wounded. He was lying with his face to the wall.
I was sitting on the window sill, looking out into
the street when Major Motley walked up to where
Clark was asleep and gave him a kick in the back,
thereby waking him. Clark raised up and asked,
“What do you want, Ras’?” when Motley produced
a pair of handcuffs he had held behind him and put
them on him. Turning around to me, he said, “I
will have a pair here for you in a few minutes,” but
as it turned out fortunately there was not another
pair of handcuffs in Bowling Green, and he had to
send to Louisville after them. After he left the
prison Doctor Vertriece suggested to me that I write
a letter to Colonel Hawkins, who was then in command
of the post, telling him that I was a wounded
Confederate soldier, and that Major Motley had
threatened to put handcuffs on me. I stated in this
letter that our command had captured thousands of
their men and had always treated them humanely
and kindly, notably the Ninth Michigan and Third
Minnesota, who, after we had paroled them and
when parting with us, said, “If any of you Texas
Rangers are captured, call for the Ninth Michigan
and Third Minnesota, and we will see that you are
well treated.” In winding up my letter to Colonel
Hawkins, I called on him as a gentleman and a soldier
not to permit such an outrage perpetrated
as that of placing irons on a wounded prisoner.
This letter Doctor Vertriece succeeded in smuggling
around Major Motley, bribing a guard to take it
directly to Colonel Hawkins without Motley’s
knowledge, and we soon had an answer returned in
the same manner from Colonel Hawkins, expressing
his regret at our condition, praising Major Motley
as a very kind-hearted and good man, and stating
that he was satisfied he would do all in his power
to alleviate our condition and suffering, and trusting
that we would be able to bear up with our condition.</p>

<p>When I read the letter I threw it on the floor,
and told Doctor Vertriece he was mistaken in his
man; that Colonel Hawkins was no better than the
rest of them. He picked up the letter, read it and
told me that I was doing a great injustice to Colonel
Hawkins, that I was simply misconstruing his position,
that he could not have said anything more to
me, a prisoner belonging to the army of his enemy,
and could certainly not censure Major Motley, an
officer of his own army, for his treatment of us, and
furthermore suggested that if I would just wait he
was satisfied that the handcuffs would not be put
on me.</p>

<p>The next day Major Motley again visited our
prison, walked up to Lieutenant Clark and took off
his handcuffs, hardly able to look into his face.
Turning around, he walked up and down the cell a
few times in study, and finally stopped in front of
me, saying, “Graber, I want you and Clark to understand
that I have no personal feeling in this matter;
you are prisoners, have been placed in my charge
and keeping; you have tried to make your escape
with Major Ousley, and, I am going to keep you here,
if I have to chain you to this floor.”</p>

<p>I frequently told Major Motley that if they were
holding me for court martial, to bring my charges
and specifications, to which he replied that I needn’t
be in a hurry, I would receive them sooner than I
wanted to, perhaps, and, when finally brought, the
charge was being a Guerilla; specifications, my own
statement admitting to General Judah that we had
been engaged in raiding their lines of communications
and destroying them ever since we had been
in the army. I concluded they need not resort to
any trial, as I was prepared to admit the specifications.
In this charge they gave my name, company
and regiment, C. S. A. (so-called), which was
virtually an admission that I was not a Guerilla,
but by an order, No. 38, of General Burnside, all
recruiting officers captured within his department
should be treated as spies, and all raiding parties,
not under a general officer, as Guerillas. Finally
one day Major Motley came in about ten o’clock
in the morning and ordered me to prepare to leave
on the eleven o’clock train for Louisville. I asked
him, “What for? Are you sending me up there
for safe keeping, or to be treated as a prisoner of
war?” He said, “Never mind about that; you will
learn soon enough.” When I reached Louisville
I was taken to the general prison and there treated
as a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>I found the Louisville prison a most excellent
one; two barracks running parallel, with bunks on
each side and a brick-paved yard in the center,
with a splendid waterworks. At one end were the
offices occupied by clerks and an officer who kept
the roll; at the other end was the kitchen, connected
on one side with a barrack, and on the other
side having a passageway of about three feet, leading
into the backyard in the rear of the kitchen,
where they had the sinks, and this backyard was
kept in a very filthy condition. We had three
rations a day, with coffee in the mornings, the
rations consisting of a chunk of light bread and
a piece of pickled pork, already cut in proper size
for each man, in tubs, on each side of the door.
On the inside of the kitchen stood a tub, presided
over by negro wenches who would shove these rations
to us as we passed through, single file, into
the backyard.</p>

<p>A negro official, called “Captain Black” by the
prisoners, frequently stood on the outside of the
door as the prisoners passed in to draw their rations.
When some poor, emaciated prisoner, reduced
by confinement, barely able to drag his feet, came
along, he would curse, tell him to “Hike out, you
d—m Rebel,” and sometimes push them along.
This made me fear this negro to the extent that I
always avoided him and always moved quickly in
his presence, determined never to give him an opportunity
to insult me.</p>

<p>One day I was lying on my bunk, the second
from the floor, about five feet high, which was the
end of the bunks next to the door. I was feeling
bad and having considerable fever, and was still
suffering from my wounds, so I decided not to go
out and get my dinner rations. All that were able
had gone out, a few sick remaining in the barracks
at different places. A little negro boy came to the
door and looking up at me, asked if I was sick
and didn’t I want a cup of coffee. I told him yes, to
bring me a cup and I would pay him for it. He
brought me a small tin cup full of fine coffee, for
which I gave him a twenty-five-cent bill.</p>

<p>While lying sipping my coffee, resting on my
right elbow, “Captain Black” stepped into the
door, and, on discovering me said, “What are you
doing here, sir?” I said I was sick and didn’t want
my rations. He raised up on his toes and said,
“Sick?” “Yes, I am sick, too,” and he started to
order me out when I lost all control of myself and,
from my bunk, fell right over on him, grabbing at
his pistol. I got my hand on it, but he jerked away
before I could clinch it, but he thought I had it,
saying, “Foh Gawd, Massa; don’t, Massa!” then
broke for the gate. Some of the prisoners witnessed
the trouble and told the others when they
came in from drawing their rations, which created
considerable excitement and considerable sympathy
for me, for it was believed that I would be placed
in irons and in a dungeon.</p>

<p>In about half an hour after the prisoners returned
from drawing their rations, one of them
rushed up to me and suggested that I hide. He said,
“That negro, with a big sergeant, is in the yard
hunting you.” I told him that I would not hide,
but would go and meet them, walking out into the
yard. The negro pointed me out to the sergeant,
when he walked up to me and told me to hold up
my hands. I asked him, “What for?” He said,
“To put these things on you,” producing a pair of
handcuffs, which he had held behind him. I asked
who ordered it done? He stated, Colonel Orcutt.
I asked, “Who is Colonel Orcutt?” He said, “Commander
of this prison.” I told him, “All right; put
them on; they are Yankee bracelets, and I consider
it an honor to wear them.”</p>

<p>After wearing these irons two or three days
and nights, an officer in fatigue uniform, whom I
took to be Colonel Orcutt, stepped up to me and
told me to hold up my hands. I asked him what
for? He said, “To take those things off.” I told
him he needn’t be in a hurry, I had got used to them
and considered it an honor to wear them. By this
time he had unlocked them and taken them off.
When I turned my back on him and mingled with
the crowd, some of the prisoners told me that he
started to strike me with them, which I hardly believe.</p>

<p>“Captain Black” very soon came to me and
apologized, saying that he was very sorry for what
he had done, and that he would never mistreat a
prisoner again, that “Dese soldiers had put him
up to it.” I told him I would give him five dollars
if he would steal those handcuffs for me. He said
that he would be glad to do that, and would not
charge me anything, and he soon reported that they
had not been replaced in the office, where they used
to hang, and that he couldn’t find out where they
were kept.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span><h2>CHAPTER X.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>Camp Chase—Fort Delaware—I Change My Name for the First Time and Am Finally Exchanged.</span></h2></div>

<p>After remaining in this prison about a month,
a roll was called and the prisoners whose names
were called, were ordered to get ready for exchange.
We started next morning for City Point, as we were
told, but when we reached Columbus, Ohio, we were
ordered to march to Camp Chase, where we were
quartered in barracks, partitioned into mess rooms
of twenty-four in a mess. While here I was very
uneasy, expecting to be called for at any time, to
be returned to Louisville, as several of the prisoners
had been so returned, to meet charges against them,
hence concluded perhaps my name appeared on the
roll through mistake, but I was fortunate enough to
escape this fate and got along fine until I was taken
sick with flux. While confined in this prison I was
furnished a New York paper, I think it was the
Tribune, giving an account of the hanging of one
of our comrades of the regiment by the name of
Dodd, who was captured near Knoxville, Tennessee,
having had his horse killed in an engagement
near there, and was ordered to make his way out
as best he could. He was raised in Sevier County,
and decided to visit his home, while there, and
when captured, was taken to Knoxville, there tried
as a spy by a court martial, convicted and sentenced
to be hung. His conviction was secured on a pocket
diary, which he had kept, recording his every-day
work.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the New York Tribune, who
visited him in the jail just before his execution,
claimed he found him a very intelligent, educated
gentleman, in fact, believed him to be a grand character,
and his execution, which he witnessed, proved
such a horrible affair that it elicited the following
expression from him: “In the name of humanity and
all that is decent, if the terrible exigencies of war
require the deliberate taking of human life, let the
prisoner be shot or give us the merciful guillotine.”</p>

<p>Satisfied if the members of the regiment heard
of Dodd’s execution they would certainly retaliate,
and in return the Federal Army would also retaliate,
and as I was the only member of the Eighth
Texas, their prisoner, they would certainly call for
me for such purpose.</p>

<p>After remaining in this prison for a month I
agreed with one of Morgan’s men to tunnel out under
the fence, and prepared to go to work that night.
The fence was only about twenty yards from our
mess room, the identical place where one of Morgan’s
officers had dug out a few months before and
effected his escape. During this day we were suddenly
called on to move and were again promised
that we should be sent to City Point for exchange.
All the sick in the hospital were furnished conveyances
to carry them to Columbus, where we took
train. As stated heretofore, I had a severe case of
flux, which weakened me a great deal, and I was
rendered unable to walk soon after we started on
our march to Columbus, a distance of about four
miles. We were marched by fours with a heavy
advance and rear guard and a single file guard on
each side of our column. After having marched
about a mile I gave out completely, and my comrades
reported my case to a lieutenant, marching
by the side of us, who instructed me to sit down by
the roadside and wait until the rear guard came
up; then to tell them to make a detail to stay with
me until I reached Columbus. Very soon after the
main body had passed, one of the rear guards called
out: “Hike out, you d—— Rebel,” which, of
course, made me resentful and I refused to hike
out, telling him that I had orders to stop and tell
some of the rear guard to bring me up to Columbus.
By this time he had got pretty close to me and I
happening to look around found him charging on
me with a bayonet, which made me jump, and
proved the best medicine I could have taken for
flux. It simply infused new strength and enabled
me to hike to Columbus.</p>

<p>At Erie, Pennsylvania, we were put in coal cars
with the bottoms pretty thickly covered with coal
dust, in which we were carried to Philadelphia, being
marched through Chestnut Street to a boat
landing.</p>

<p>Their object in moving us in these coal cars we
construed to be a policy to make us look as dirty as
possible. Many of our men, of course, were somewhat
ragged, and, altogether, we appeared a motley
crowd, in striking contrast to the heroes that had
been cherished by our Northern sympathizers,
called “copper-heads” by the fanatics of the North.
In our march to the boat landing we were greeted
by many intelligent ladies, who were standing on
the streets watching our passing, and quite a number
of them had their hands full of postage money,
which was bills of denominations of less than a dollar,
which they threw and scattered among us.
After we reached the boat, on which we were ordered
up on the second deck, a dray-load of
cheese and crackers was sent down to us
by some of the ladies, but the guards on the
lower deck appropriated it, and, after eating as
much as they wanted, sold the balance of it to all
that had money. Then, adding insult to injury,
they sent word to the ladies to send more—to be
treated in the same manner. The boat then moved
out down the river where our journey to City Point
for exchange terminated at Fort Delaware, where
we were unloaded and were roughly treated.</p>

<p>Fort Delaware proved to be the worst prison we
had been in; dirty, with no water fit to drink. Our
drinking water had to be taken from the canal inside
of the levee, which had a green scum floating
on top, and, on the lower part of the island, was
used for bathing. After about two or three weeks,
an arrangement was made with a boat called the
“Osceola” to bring us water from the Brandywine
River, which proved to be palatable and a great
treat.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Fort Delaware we found about
twenty thousand prisoners, a large part of them
captured at the battle of Gettysburg; among whom
were four or five hundred of Hood’s Brigade, and
also some from Granbury’s Brigade, who were captured
at Vicksburg. This created a sad impression
on me and made me wish I was back in the saddle
again more than I ever did, but there was nothing
to do but submit. While here we also heard of the
battle of Chickamauga, the first report of which was
most encouraging, as it stated their army was annihilated
and Thomas had fled to the mountains. This
started the Rebel yell in the prison, and made us
feel that we would soon be exchanged, but the next
day’s report put a damper on our enthusiasm, and
made us feel sad indeed, as the report in this New
York paper was that their army had rallied and
were holding on to Chattanooga, with our army retreating,
and, while their loss was very heavy in
killed and wounded, ours was double. It made us
realize that fate was against us, and we would never
be able to gain a decisive victory, which would
unquestionably secure our recognition by foreign
governments.</p>

<p>As already stated, Fort Delaware proved the
worst prison we had been in; smallpox broke out
among us and nearly every other disease known. A
large number died. Every morning they called at
the big gate, “Bring out your dead!” and the dead
were buried on the Jersey shore by a detail of prisoners.</p>

<p>Among one of these details one morning was a
gentleman by the name of Simpson, from Houston,
Texas, who belonged to Hood’s Brigade. This man
was born and raised in New York State and had
lived in Houston only a couple of years, engaging in
business and had become thoroughly acquainted
with the character of our people, and especially the
institution of slavery. In this short time he became
one of the South’s strongest friends, ready to give
his life for her cause, as demonstrated by his joining
the first troops Texas sent to Virginia.</p>

<p>Slipping away from the guards, he made his way
to his old home, told his people who had heard that
he was in the Rebel Army that he had recanted
and taken the oath of allegiance to the United
States Government, thereby reinstating him with
his family, who lavished money and all else on him
until he was fully recuperated from the effects of
his prison experience, when he again shipped on
board a steamer for Nassau, where he took a Confederate
blockade runner and came South, to fight
it out to the end. After the war he entered into
copartnership with a man by the name of Wiggins,
constituting the firm of Wiggins &amp; Simpson, which
built a large foundry and machine shop. This they
conducted for many years, and, at the time of his
death, Simpson was wealthy and one of the most
honored and esteemed citizens of Houston, never
having expressed a word of regret over his conduct
during the war.</p>

<p>It might not be out of place here to say that
nearly all Northern-raised men among us within my
knowledge pursued the same course. They invariably
proved gallant soldiers and did their duty for
the South to the limit of their ability, returning
South after the war and spending the balance of
their lives as our most honored citizens. We had
twenty-six generals of Northern birth in the Confederate
Army, twelve of whom were graduates of West
Point, and were offered high rank in the Federal
Army. This, no doubt, proved a hard problem for
the North to understand, and only emphasizes the
justice of our cause, because these men were
prompted only by a conscientious motive, and faced
suffering, death and disgrace in the eyes of their
Northern friends by such a course.</p>

<p>While on this subject I would mention the case
of General Pemberton, the gallant soldier who commanded
at Vicksburg, and directed its defense to
the last ditch. He was the son of wealthy parents in
Philadelphia, who threatened to disinherit him if he
didn’t resign his commission in the Southern Army
and come North, but he ignored their threat and continued
in the Southern Army to the end.</p>

<p>Our suffering at Fort Delaware was almost unbearable.
We were crowded into these barracks as
thick as we could lie, with all character of sickness
and disease among us, receiving additional prisoners
occasionally to keep the barracks filled, with
only two meals a day of three small crackers and an
inch of meat. Many prisoners got desperate and
attempted to swim the Delaware River to effect their
escape, only to have their dead bodies found washed
ashore on the Delaware or Jersey side of the river
the next day.</p>

<p>A number of our men were shot without cause
by the guard, who, we understood, were promoted
for such act; still a few of the men made their escape
by swimming the river, among whom I might
mention Jim Loggins, a boy about eighteen years
old, who belonged to Hood’s Brigade. He is now a
practicing physician of Ennis, Texas, a father of a
large family of children, all highly regarded and respected
citizens of their home town.</p>

<p>Prisoners seeking their escape would take canteens,
tightly corked, and use them as life preservers.
Referring back to the case of Jim Loggins:
When he got into the river with others, the tide was
running in fast, and the tide took him about five
or six miles up the river before he reached a
landing on the Delaware side. He then, with one
companion, made his way through the State of Delaware
into Maryland, crossing the Potomac, then
through Northern Virginia, occupied by the Federal
Army, back to Richmond, where he rejoined Hood’s
Brigade, and was in every important battle until the
end of the war, surrendering at Appomattox.</p>

<p>Among our prisoners at Fort Delaware were the
First Maryland Cavalry, captured at South Mountain,
before the battle of Gettysburg. These Maryland
men were the sons of leading families, largely
men of great wealth in the State of Maryland. Their
friends and families at home petitioned Governor
Swann, of Maryland, to intercede for them with the
Federal War Department, and permit them to take
a parole to go home, and stay at their homes, until
regularly exchanged, and it was generally believed
success would crown their efforts. These men received
clothing and money in the greatest abundance
from their families at home, and were about the
most genteel looking men we had in prison. In connection
with this, I would mention the escape of one
of their parties, who, being well dressed and clean
shaven, wearing a white shirt and fresh collar, was
watching the “Osceola” at the landing about ready
to depart, and boldly slipped up on the levee, walked
down to the guard, passing him while the guard
saluted, mistaking him for a citizen visitor from
Delaware City, who came over quite often, then
passed on to the boat, walked up on its cabin deck,
took a seat in front, with his feet cocked up on the
guards, smoking a cigar, when the boat pushed off
with him and he was never heard of by us any more,
no doubt making good his escape.</p>

<p>Many incidents of interest I might mention,
showing the loyalty of the Southern soldier under
this most terrible condition, facing death daily, seeing
his comrades carried out by the dozen for burial
daily, with no prospect for exchange. Certainly history
does not record such remarkable devotion to a
country and cause.</p>

<p>In line with this, I might mention the effort of
General Schoepf, commander of the fort and prison.
He one day conceived the idea of creating a stampede
among us, for which purpose he ordered out
about three hundred East Tennesseeans, formed
them in line and made a strong speech to them, telling
them of the North’s vast resources for the conduct
of the war, and our diminishing, limited means
for holding on; showing them the impossibility for
our ever succeeding, with no prospect of exchange.
Then he told them of the great prosperity of the
North, where labor was in demand and wages high,
of which they could take the benefit by taking the
oath of allegiance and thus save their lives, recover
their health and strength, live in peace and happiness
the balance of the war, and, finally, he called
on them, saying, “Now, all of you that are ready
and willing to take the oath of allegiance, step three
paces to the front.” Only one man responded.</p>

<p>General Schoepf evidently thought that East
Tennessee, as a section of country in the South, was
the most disloyal to our cause, its citizens being
largely Union people, and that these East Tennesseeans
would certainly accept his liberal offer, and,
by that means, make a break in our ranks. It is
hardly necessary to say that he gave it up as a bad
job, and did not attempt another such experiment.
In connection with this, however, I regret to have
to say that a few weak brothers were found in our
ranks, who took the oath of allegiance and were then
separated from the rest of the prisoners, in a special
camp about a half mile distant, where they were
designated by us as “Galvanized Yankees.”</p>

<p>After spending a part of the winter at Fort Delaware,
one morning there appeared a notice at what
we called a postoffice, inside of the big gate, calling
upon all Marylanders, prisoners of war, to appear
at the gate with their baggage; which, of course,
was construed to mean that Governor Swann had
succeeded in his effort to secure a parole for these
Marylanders, and that they would be taken to Washington
for the purpose of being paroled and permitted
to go home to remain until properly exchanged.
This, of course, created considerable excitement
and rejoicing among the Marylanders,
which was shared largely by the rest of the prisoners,
although they could not hope to ever be favored
in the same manner. It was a source of comfort
and gratification to us to know that some of our
friends, at least, would be saved the sufferings and
almost certain death, even if we could not share it
with them.</p>

<p>While they were forming in line, by fours, headed
for the big gate, an acquaintance belonging to
Hood’s Brigade, whose name was Robert Brantley,
of Navasota, called to me and said, “Good-bye,
Henry.” I said, “Where are you going, Bob?” He
said, “I am going to try to get out with these men.”
I said, “How are you going to try to do that?” He
said, “I have two names and am going to answer to
one of them at roll call.” I said, “Bob, you do not
want two names; you can’t answer to both. If you
will give me one of them I will try to go out with
you.” He said, “All right, come on.” I had time
enough to go into the barracks and get an oilcloth
satchel, which had been given me at Bowling Green;
then I had a magnificent cape overcoat, left me by
Major Ousley in Bowling Green prison; with this
coat on and this citizen’s new satchel, the coat extending
over the top of my boots, hiding partly worn
butternut pants. I passed for a Marylander pretty
well, seemingly as well dressed as they were, while
Bob looked ragged, like one of these Hood Brigade
men that had not had any clothing furnished them
in some time, and appeared rather suspicious among
this well dressed crowd. In giving me the name he
retained the name of Charles Erbert, who belonged
to the First Maryland Cavalry, and who had died
in prison. The name of Charles Stanley, which he
gave me to use, was the name of a son of a preacher
Charles Stanley was sick in the hospital, and his
father, ostensibly to preach to the troops at the
fort, was permitted the privilege of a visit, mainly
for the purpose of being with his son in the hospital.</p>

<p>The keeper of the prison roll was a Lieutenant
Wolff, a renegade Virginian, who was also a “Galvanized
Yankee.” Wolff was also acquainted with
many of the Marylanders, and particularly with
Charles Stanley, on account of his father visiting
there. Wolff’s acquaintance with the Marylanders
was through their clothing and money sent them,
which passed through his hands.</p>

<p>We were soon marched out to the wharf, where
the “Osceola” was awaiting us to carry us to the
flag of truce boat, “New York,” anchored in midstream,
as the water was too shallow for her to come
up to the wharf. We were held on the wharf for
nearly an hour before a roll call commenced, during
which time I suggested to Bob to separate, for him
to take the opposite edge of the party to the edge
that I would take, then to post himself on the circumstances
of his man’s capture and the location
of his home in Maryland, telling him that we might
be questioned, and, if posted, we could have a ready
answer, thereby keeping down suspicion. Bob said
he did not think there was any danger in that; his
greatest apprehension was that he would be personally
recognized by some of the Yankees, as he had
been at work in the cook house, where he made the
acquaintance of quite a number, and he thought
perhaps Lieutenant Wolff might recognize him,
while I had no fear of anything of that kind.</p>

<p>Finally a major, with several other officers, appeared.
Lieutenant Wolff was already there. The
major began calling the roll alphabetically. When
he called the name of Charles Erbert, Bob failed to
answer. I decided if he called it the second time
that I would answer to the dead man’s name, believing
that Bob had lost his nerve and would not
answer at all. When he called the name the second
time we both answered, but I kept down, while he
jumped up quickly. This drew the major’s attention
to him, and he never knew who it was that
answered over on my side of the crowd. I forgot
to mention that we were all squatted down on the
wharf. When Bob walked out boldly, attempting
to pass the major, on his way to the boat, the major
stopped him. “What is your name, sir?” “My
name is Charles Erbert.” The major, without any
further questioning, told him to take a seat and
called up a guard to take charge of him. This sudden
decision of the major that there was fraud was
no doubt prompted by both of us answering to the
same name, yet it created a suspicion with me that
perhaps we had been betrayed, as they kept a lot
of spies in the prison all the time. As considerable
time was consumed in calling the names, down to
the letter S, I had ample time to prepare for the
issue, and when the name of Charles Stanley was
called I jumped up and boldly went forward, passing
him, without looking. I was favored by Lieutenant
Wolff being engaged in shaking hands with
one of the Marylanders and eating an apple with
his back turned to the major when he called the
name of Charles Stanley, evidently not hearing it,
and which I did not permit him to call the second
time. I therefore passed through unmolested. As
heretofore stated, my appearance tallied pretty well
with the rest of the Marylanders and Bob Brantley’s
appearance was in striking contrast with theirs.</p>

<p>After getting on the boat and mixing with the
Marylanders, I was congratulated by them on my
success and promised a good time when they reached
home. As soon as all were aboard, the “New
York” weighed anchor, when, the next morning,
running down the coast on the Atlantic, we were
told that we would have to remain down in the hold
on the second deck until they could wash decks.
They closed down the hatch and only permitted us
to come on the main deck when we discovered that
we were at Point Lookout, Maryland, under the
guns of a thirty-two-pound battery, and the Potomac
flotilla, and were then told to march out, and
were led into what we called a “bull pen,” where
we found about ten or twelve thousand prisoners
quartered in little A tents on the sand of the seashore,
with nothing else to protect them from the
winter’s blast. Had we suspected their motive, we
could have easily overpowered the guard on the big
steamer, beached and burned her and scattered out
in Maryland, without taking a parole. At Point
Lookout our camp was laid off in State divisions,
a row of little A tents on each side of a wide street
with a cook house for each division at the head of
it. We were here furnished rations the same as we
had at Fort Delaware, by marching in and taking
our position at the long table in front of each ration.
Sometimes we had a cup of what they called
bean soup, but it was always my misfortune to get
a cup of bean water, the cook failing to stir up the
soup and thoroughly mixing the beans with the water.
Besides this, we had three crackers and an
inch of meat. This we had twice a day, as at Fort
Delaware, and considerable suffering on account of
hunger was thereby entailed.</p>

<p>As stated, we were quartered in tents by State
Divisions. Coming there with the Marylanders,
under a Marylander’s name, I started with the
Maryland Division, but in connection with this, soon
joined the Texas Division, Tennessee Division and
Louisiana Division and drew rations with every one
of these divisions, thereby securing three extra rations
which I divided among my messmates.</p>

<p>In order to improve my time, with nothing else
to do, I decided to try to learn the French language
and for this purpose, joined a Louisiana mess, the
men belonging to the Seventh Louisiana, who were
Creoles and spoke nothing but French in their mess.
In a short time, I was enabled to understand some
of their talk and they, as well as I, thought I was
getting along fine, and I believe if I could have continued
with them six months I would have spoken
French fluently.</p>

<p>While at this point General Butler was appointed
Exchange Agent, this in response to the clamor of
the people in the North, demanding exchange, as
their people were dying in our prisons, as well as
our people in theirs; but, the policy of their War
Department, sanctioned by Abraham Lincoln, was
not to exchange a prisoner if they could avoid it.
They did not want to reinforce our army from that
source when our country was about exhausted for
men. To carry their point on this they cared very
little for their men in our prisons and even openly
claimed that it was a protection to their army to
enforce non-exchange even at the sacrifice of the
men in our prisons.</p>

<p>General Butler being placed in charge of the exchange,
the Federal Government knew that they
could throw the odium of refusal to exchange on the
Confederate Government, because General Butler
had been outlawed by our Government through President
Davis’ proclamation ordering him executed
whenever captured, on account of his dastardly conduct
while in command of New Orleans, which earned
for him the name of “Beast” Butler. They well
knew that his appointment as Chief Exchange Agent
would forever place a barrier against exchange.</p>

<p>At this time General Marsden was in command
at Point Lookout, and a Captain Patterson, aided
by Sergeant Finnegan, in charge of the prisoners.</p>

<p>After the arrival of the Marylanders at Point
Lookout, the Federal Government decided to relieve
the crowded condition of Fort Delaware by transferring
more prisoners to Point Lookout, which was
done to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>General Butler, for political reasons, as well as to
show his interest in the prisoners, made us a visit,
and when his arrival was announced, proceeded in
company with General Marsden and their respective
staffs, to ride over to our enclosure. We were then
called on by Captain Patterson, announcing his approach,
to cheer him as he came inside. As soon
as the big gate was thrown open and he rode in,
perhaps five thousand prisoners had collected at the
gate, many of them calling out, “Boys, here is the
‘Beast;’ ” to which he paid no attention or to the
name of “Mumford,” the man whom he hung in New
Orleans for tearing down the United States flag
placed on his house on their first occupancy of New
Orleans. When he and General Marsden attempted
to enter the First Division, which was the Louisiana
Division, the men called out “New Orleans.” By
this time such a crowd had gathered in this division
that it was difficult for them to ride through, when
General Butler decided not to go any further and
returned to General Marsden’s headquarters.</p>

<p>About two weeks later General Butler returned
and entered the prison enclosure with General Marsden
and their respective staffs; all armed with pistols,
and having also an escort of about fifty cavalry.
They were determined to push through the Louisiana
Division, when again the insults thrown at them
on his first visit were repeated. In reaching a Sibley
tent, where a part of a company of the Louisiana
Guard Battery were quartered, one of the young
men, seeing General Butler passing in front of the
tent, rushed out, took Butler’s horse by the bridle
and stopped him, proposed three cheers for Jeff
Davis, which were given with a will by our ten
thousand throats, then proposed three groans for
the “Beast.”</p>

<p>General Butler turned pale, looked at the men,
seemed undecided what to do, surrounded by an
angry crowd of at least ten thousand men, who
although unarmed, he well knew were more than
a match for him and his guards and that they would
not stand any show for their lives if a single shot
was fired. He decided it was best to move on and
pass the incident. When nearly at the end of the
division some one called “Magruder,” which made
him smile, as it referred to the battle of Big Bethel,
which he commanded and lost to the Confederates
commanded by General Magruder.</p>

<p>He next turned into the North Carolina Division,
a brigade of conscripts, who had surrendered without
firing a gun. On his entering this division the
men cheered him, when he stopped and talked with
them, asking how they were getting along. They
told him they did not get enough to eat and were
starving, and he turned to Captain Patterson and
told him to add an extra cracker to the rations,
which brought another cheer. He then passed
through the division, being cheered frequently by
these conscripts and returned to General Marsden’s
headquarters.</p>

<p>In punishment for the insults offered him in the
Louisiana Division, he sent a regiment, composed
of illiterate negroes from the plantations in North
Carolina, to guard us. The immediate guard of the
prison were on beats on a platform outside of the
prison walls, which exposed their heads and shoulders
to the prisoners inside of the walls. There
were also guard beats at the head of every division
between the tents and the cook houses. These
negroes were very poorly drilled and disciplined,
but fit tools in the hands of a vindictive enemy. As
the men in the prison had never seen any negro
troops, they gathered along these different beats
to watch their performance. They came into the
prison for guard duty, carrying their knapsacks as
they were afraid to leave them in their camp, fearing
that some of the other troops not on duty would
rob them. A guard at the head of the Texas Division,
tired of carrying his knapsack, deposited
it at the end of his beat; as soon as his back was
turned, one of the men picked it up and ran away
with it. The negro, returning on his beat, discovered
his knapsack gone and created a general laugh
among the spectators by his puzzled look. Finally
he said, “Men, you better give me back my knapsack
or I’ll call Marse Lieutenant.” The men
again laughed, when finally he called to the guard
up on the fence, “Central, Oh Central! Call Marse
Lieutenant and tell him one of dese here white
folks stole my knapsack,” when in due time the
officer of the day came in on horseback, dashed up
to the guard and asked what was the matter. The
guard said, “Marse Lieutenant, some of these white
folks stole my knapsack,” which created additional
laughter and merriment. The lieutenant called on
the men to return the knapsack, and said that if
they didn’t, he would order a search of the camp.
This they could not afford to have done. In the
meantime, the negro said if they would just give
him back his “bacca” and guarretype, he wouldn’t
care anything about the balance. The men then returned
the knapsack to keep the camp from being
searched.</p>

<p>Our troubles with this negro guard commenced
the first night, when they shot into the camp
whenever they heard any noise. They were undoubtedly
instigated by their officers and the white soldiers.</p>

<p>There were a number of attempts to escape, one
novel plan being evolved by the Marylanders. The
smallpox broke out inside of the prison, and a pesthouse
was established on the main land in the piney
woods, about three or four miles from the Point.
I forgot to mention Point Lookout is a peninsula,
connected with the mainland by a very narrow strip,
where a strong fort was located, and where these
negroes were quartered. We also had an ordinary
hospital inside of the enclosure, immediately in
charge of Confederate surgeons, but supervised by
a Federal surgeon, who would receive their report
every morning on the conditions of the sick, the
number of the dead, etc. A couple of Marylanders
would blister their faces and hands with hot wire,
giving it the appearance of smallpox; the Confederate
surgeon would point out these two cases having
developed smallpox during the night, when they
were ordered out to the pesthouse. They were
then carried in a one-horse cart out to the pesthouse
in the piney woods, where they only had one guard
on duty with his beat in front of the door. The
Confederate surgeon immediately in charge, at this
pesthouse, would add a couple of boxes in connection
with others, for the dead that had passed away
during the night, and would report these two men
among the other dead of the night. These boxes
were then buried by Confederate convalescents, and
that was the end of it. The two Marylanders, during
the night, had slipped by the single guard with
his beat in front of the door, then managed to cross
the Potuxan River, either by swimming or floating
on planks or logs, there being an only bridge which
had a strong cavalry guard and could not be crossed
without the countersign.</p>

<p>When I was made acquainted with the scheme
by Judge Wilson of the Hood’s Texas Brigade, who
was a Mason and had a number of Masonic friends
among the Marylanders, there were two men out
then and after giving them a reasonable time to get
away, he had made arrangements for he and I to go
out next, but alas, the two men out then were captured
and exposed the whole plan, which put an end
to it.</p>

<p>Another plan of escape was attempted by others,
that of wading out in the bay on dark nights, in
water deep enough to barely expose their heads, but
when they got opposite the fort those shrewd
Yankees had cast an anchor about a quarter of a
mile out, to which was attached a rope and the rope
attached to a bell inside of the fort, so when the
prisoner, wading along in the deep water, would
strike this rope, he would ring the bell, which invariably
resulted in his discovery.</p>

<p>Other attempts at escape by some of the Marylanders,
through bribery of the guard at the gate
leading out on the bay shore, invariably failed.
The guards would take the bribe, then report the
case when he permitted the prisoners to pass out of
the gate. The escaping prisoners would then be
charged on by a lot of cavalry in waiting around the
corner of the fence and shot down by them.</p>

<p>General Butler next conceived the idea to go to
Richmond with a batch of prisoners and attempt an
exchange, not for the purpose of relieving the prisoners,
but simply to test his own case with the Confederate
Government. On his arrival at City Point,
it seems some arrangement was made that enabled
him to deliver these prisoners, presumably in a fair
exchange for prisoners held by us. In this batch
of prisoners were a number of Marylanders, who
thoughtlessly published in a Richmond paper their
sufferings and hardships, as well as ill treatment at
the hands of the Federal authorities, and particularly
denounced Captain Patterson, who had charge
of the Point Lookout prison, in most bitter terms.
By accident Captain Patterson got hold of a copy
of a Richmond paper containing these charges and
with it, went to the Maryland Division, read it to the
men and told them if further exchanges were had
he would see to it that the Marylanders should be
the last to leave there.</p>

<p>After this, the Marylanders in the prison, having
denounced the article as ill advised and improper,
began again to court the favor of Captain Patterson
and, after several months, concluded that they had
about succeeded in regaining his confidence. One
morning they were notified to get ready to go to City
Point for exchange. Of course, there was considerable
enthusiasm among the Marylanders and I decided
to go out with them, in the name of Stanley.
We were marched out and carried into another bull
pen, kept there five or six hours, when we were permitted
to return into our old quarters and found the
Tennessee Division had been placed aboard the flag
of truce boat and sailed for City Point. It is hardly
necessary to say that I was the greatest disappointed
man among them, because I also belonged to the
Tennessee Division.</p>

<p>In about two weeks the Louisiana Division was
called for, to which I also belonged and availed myself
of the Louisianan’s name, the owner of which
was dead, and passed out with them.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the James River we passed a
fleet of gunboats and ships, and in due time arrived
at City Point, where we anchored in midstream.
The exchange agent, Major Mulford, immediately
went ashore and telegraphed to Richmond our arrival.
We were anchored here several days, expecting
hourly a Confederate boat to put in its appearance
with the equivalent of Federal prisoners to be
returned in exchange. After several days, having
been told that our boat surely would arrive the
second day, and as it had not put in its appearance,
we decided that there was a hitch somewhere and
that we were liable to be carried back. We expected,
hourly, a couple of gunboats to come in sight
to escort us back to Point Lookout.</p>

<p>The situation, to us, began to look gloomy, and
created a feeling of desperation. We were determined
never to be taken back to look inside of another
prison. In accordance therewith we soon
made up a party of about a hundred, agreeing to
overpower the guard on the boat if the Confederate
boat didn’t make its appearance by ten o’clock next
morning.</p>

<p>On the cabin deck of this boat were quite a number
of Confederate officers, among them General W.
H. Fitts Lee, who had been wounded and captured.
He was a son of General Robert E. Lee, and to him
we communicated our intentions and asked their
support. He replied, urging us to make no such
attempt, that everything was all right and the object
of our trip would be carried out without doubt.
I told the men that we could not afford to accept
his advice; that we had too much at stake, and I
construed General Lee’s position to be prompted by
what he conceived his duty as a Confederate officer.
I urged them, by all means, to carry out our plan.</p>

<p>The next day about noon I was sound asleep
under the stepladder leading up to the hatch, when
awakened by considerable tumult around me. I
discovered about a half dozen men on the
ladder, ready to make a charge on the upper deck,
where the guards were located. It so happened
that the man at the top of the ladder hesitated and
by way of encouragement, I called to him, “Don’t
you stop there; put your shoulders under the hatch
and throw it off.” He proved to be an Irishman
who said, “The divil, you say; you come up here
and take my place.” There was nothing to do
but climb up the ladder and take his place. I soon
put my back to the hatch and sent it up, whirling
on the deck, and jumped on the deck myself. The
guard on duty threw his gun down on me, telling
me to go back or he would kill me. I called to the
men, “Come on, boys,” but none would follow. I
noticed General Lee in the front part of the boat,
motioning to me, “Go back; go back.” It is hardly
necessary for me to say that I felt like a fool and
went back.</p>

<p>There is a member of our camp here today who
states that he was present, close to General Lee, and
saw me; his name is J. W. Middleton.</p>

<p>Our boat finally made its appearance and while
it moved up very slowly towards our boat for the
purpose of throwing a gang plank across, for us
to pass over, a party of the Louisiana Guard Battery,
a company of highly educated young men from New
Orleans, appeared on the upper deck with a Confederate
flag belonging to the Seventh Louisiana,
tacked on to a piece of scantling in the center.
General Lee and Colonel Davis of the Eighth Virginia
were at one end of the line. These young men,
who were splendid singers, with fine voices, struck
up:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Farewell forever to the Star Spangled Banner,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;No longer shall it wave over the home of the free,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Unfurled in its stead to the bold breeze of Heaven,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thirteen bright stars around the palmetto tree.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p>These lines constituted the chorus of the song,
which was sung with a great deal of spirit, and joined
in by many of the men and officers. I forgot to
mention that while the boats were coming together
the Federal prisoners began to twit our boys about
going back to live on corn dodgers and bacon, but
when they heard this song they were dumbfounded,
ceased their guying and simply stood speechless.</p>

<p>On our arrival at the Rockets, a place of landing
in Richmond, we were met by a great many citizens,
mostly ladies in carriages, and a company of Richmond
cadets, escorted us to the Capitol Square,
where we were met by President and Mrs. Davis,
who shook hands with every one of us. Mrs. Davis
was in tears. We were then regaled by a speech
from Governor Smith of Virginia, standing on the
platform in front of the Capitol, when among other
things he said, “They have called me from the tented
field to preside over the destinies of this great
commonwealth, because they say I am too old to be
there; but I deny the charge and want it distinctly
understood that among Yankees and women, I am
only five and twenty.”</p>

<p>Those who are acquainted with Governor Smith’s
history, knowing him at that time to be a man about
sixty-five or seventy years old, commanding a
brigade in the army when he was elected Governor,
will not be surprised at his expression. Governor
Smith was generally known as “Extra Billy.” I
will take occasion to mention that when I put my
foot on Dixie soil it proved the happiest moment of
my life up to that time; I felt like kissing the ground
that I stood on.</p>

<p>President Davis, in his speech to us, told us that
we were only paroled, and could not enter the service
again until duly exchanged. He requested those
that lived on the West of the Mississippi not to go
home on a visit, pending this exchange, stating that
he hoped we would soon be called on to return to
our respective commands, as we were greatly needed
in the army.</p>

<p>With me, this admonition was not needed, my
only ambition was to get back to my command and
again mount my horse and resume my duties. For
this purpose I sought out Senator Oldham from Texas,
who went with me to the War Department and
secured me a pass from the Secretary of War, to go
to Greenville, East Tennessee, where I learned the
Rangers were camped and in due time made my
way over there and found them in a deep snow.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span><h2>CHAPTER XI<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>The Inhumanity of the Federal Government.</span></h2></div>

<p>In reviewing my prison experience and observation,
I find that I omitted to mention a case at Bowling
Green, which will give the reader a fair idea
of the danger of capture in territory occupied by the
Federal Army and now take occasion to recall the
case of John R. Lisle, a sergeant in Morgan’s command,
who was permitted to visit his home near
Russellville, Kentucky, on a short furlough and was
shot down in his own home, in the bosom of his
family, by some Tory neighbors, the ball striking
him on top of the head, which temporarily stunned
him and while on the floor, senseless, they rushed in
and secured his capture. He had on a new gray
Confederate uniform and when searched, had an order
from General Morgan to notify all of their men
whom he met or had an opportunity to convey the
instructions, to report back to their command, having
overstayed their furlough.</p>

<p>I got acquainted with Lisle as soon as I entered
the prison and found him a very bright, intelligent
gentleman. He was then being tried by court martial
on the charge of being a spy and convicted on
this order of Morgan’s, ordering men back to their
command. During the trial he made a pencil memorandum
of the proceedings of the court martial and
finally, losing his temper one day, blessed out the
court martial, telling them that he was satisfied they
were after his blood and to stop their mockery of a
trial, to go ahead and take his life, lead him out and
shoot him. The court martial found him guilty and
assessed his punishment at death by hanging. As
soon as the findings of the court martial were returned
from General Burnside’s headquarters, approved,
he was taken down into the lower room
and had irons forged on him, taken over to the
court house under special guard to await the day
of his execution. While at the court house his wife
and oldest son, a boy about fifteen, were permitted
to see him, when he smuggled the memoranda he
had made of the proceedings of the court martial
to his wife, with instructions to send his boy to
General Bragg’s headquarters, then near Tullahoma,
Tennessee, with this memoranda, satisfied that our
Government would demand his exchange as a prisoner
of war, putting some Federal officer in confinement,
as hostage. After he was taken out of the
prison we were not permitted to learn anything more
about his fate.</p>

<p>During my imprisonment at Point Lookout,
Maryland, a batch of about five hundred prisoners
from Johnson’s Island were received there. Hastening
to the gate to watch their coming in, thinking
perhaps I might see some acquaintances, I met John
R. Lisle, who had just been released from a dungeon
at Johnson’s Island, where he had been ever since he
was moved from Bowling Green in irons—confined
in this dungeon and for the first time then treated
as a prisoner of war. There is hardly a doubt but
designating a couple of Federal officers as hostages
for his safety, had the desired effect and saved his
life. I left him at Point Lookout with the balance
of the prisoners, from whence he was finally sent
around for exchange. I had a letter from one of our
prison companions near Bowling Green, about eight
years ago, saying that Lisle finally returned South
and to his home in Kentucky, where he died only a
few years before this letter was written.</p>

<p>In order to give the reader an idea of the intense
hatred on the part of the Lincoln Government, it
might be well here to note that in the very beginning
of hostilities they adopted a policy to degrade the
Southern Army in the estimation of their own people,
as well as that of foreign countries. In order to
carry out such policy the War Department issued an
order that all executions of Confederate soldiers
convicted by court martial, should be by hanging—a
felon’s death—which order was never modified
and was carried out in its letter and spirit, never
in any case permitting an exception.</p>

<p>In this connection I would mention a case in point,
which occurred while I was a prisoner and has repeatedly
been reported in the papers of the North
and South. The case was a Colonel Johnston of the
Confederate Army, in conjunction with a lieutenant,
whose name I have forgotten, entering the Federal
lines as spies. Colonel Johnston was armed with a
fictitious order from Secretary of War Stanton to
proceed to Murfreesboro, Franklin and Nashville,
Tennessee, and inspect the Federal works at these
places. They called one evening at Franklin, presented
the Secretary of War’s order, which seemed
to be genuine, when the colonel commanding received
them very courteously and rode around with
them, inspecting his works. Colonel Johnston also
stated to him that he was just from General Rosencranz’s
headquarters, where he had inspected the
works around Murfreesboro. After the inspection
of the Franklin works Colonel Johnston told the
colonel in command that he was compelled to go to
Nashville that night and insisted on leaving at once
for Nashville, although dark had set in. The colonel
tried to persuade him to spend the night with him
but all to no purpose. After Colonel Johnston and
the lieutenant had been gone perhaps a half hour the
colonel got suspicious and wired General Rosencranz
for information, and General Rosencranz replied
that there had been no such men there, that evidently
they were spies, to not fail to capture them and
order a drumhead court martial. The colonel then
immediately ordered his horse and with a sergeant,
pursued Colonel Johnston and the lieutenant, caught
up with them some six or eight miles on the road to
Nashville, and insisted that they must go back with
him and spend the night, which they did. On their
arrival at the colonel’s headquarters he immediately
had them searched and found ample evidence on
their persons that they were Confederate soldiers,
acting as spies, notably the sword of Colonel Johnston’s
was inscribed “C. S. A.,” and Colonel Johnston
readily admitted they were spies.</p>

<p>During the session of the court martial Colonel
Johnston made himself known to the colonel commanding,
who then recognized him as a classmate at
West Point. He then made an eloquent appeal to
the court martial to save the life of the lieutenant,
telling them that he was unaware, when they started
on this expedition, of its object and finally begged
them to have him shot, to permit him to die a soldier’s
and not a felon’s death. He said to the
colonel, “When you rode up we both had our pistols
out, under the capes of our overcoats and could have
killed you easily, thereby saving our lives, but the
thought of killing an old classmate without giving

and I decided that I might talk out of it, thereby
sparing your life,” but all to no purpose, his
pleadings were ignored and he had to meet his fate
by hanging.</p>

<p>After the defeat of the Federal Army at the first
battle of Manassas, many wagonloads of handcuffs,
put up in barrels, were captured, which were intended
to be placed on the entire Confederate Army
when captured, and marched into Washington City,
wearing these bracelets.</p>

<p>Among Mr. Lincoln’s earliest proclamations was
the one declaring medicines contraband of war, thus
depriving millions of sick of medicines, one of the
most brutal and inhuman orders ever published by
a civilized Government.</p>

<br/>
<span class='sc'>I Rejoin My Command.</span></h2></div>

<p>Recurring to the meeting of my comrades at
Greenville, Tennessee, where I found them camped
in a deep snow, when they had me relate my prison
experience, etc.: They had just received orders to
move to Dalton, Georgia, where I, having no horse,
proceeded by rail. On my arrival at Dalton I found
the largest, best equipped army I had ever seen in
the Confederacy, mostly quartered in tents. Our
advance line occupied the top of a range of mountains,
presenting precipitous fronts towards the
enemy. This range of mountains was somewhat in
the shape of a horseshoe, largely surrounding Dalton
with probably a half dozen gaps, which were
strongly fortified by our forces, except Snake Creek
Gap on our left, nearly on a line with Resacca, a
railroad station immediately in our rear on the only
line entering Dalton and our only means of supplying
the army and enabling retreat. I found General
Joseph E. Johnston in command, with General
Hardee, his second in command and General Hood,
commanding a corps, immediately in front of Dalton.</p>

<p>Not having any horse and unable to secure one,
I met a friend, Captain James Britton from Lebanon,
Tennessee, who commanded Hood’s escort, who told
me that he had several horses in camp, doing nothing,
the owners of the horses being sick and confined
at the hospital; if I would come and stay with
him that I could ride any of the horses. This I
gratefully accepted, telling him that I would only
do so with the understanding that I would be treated
as a member of the company doing duty.</p>

<p>While on this duty, moving out with the escort
one morning with General Hood and staff, to his
headquarters just in the rear of Railroad Gap, I
witnessed the meeting of General J. E. Johnston,
W. J. Hardee, General Cheatham, General Hindman,
all with their respective staffs, at General Hood’s
headquarters, which were under an old workshed
with a workbench under it. General Johnston and
staff were the last to arrive. After dismounting and
shaking hands with the different generals and members
of their staffs, as also General Hood, he handed
General Hood his crutches. General Hood, it
will be remembered, lost his leg at Chickamauga and
was ever afterwards on crutches. Generals Johnston
and Hood then moved up the road about three hundred
yards out of our hearing and were soon engaged
in a very animated discussion, which lasted
perhaps three-quarters of an hour. When they returned
Generals Johnston and Hardee mounted their
horses with their respective staffs, returning to
town, and gradually the rest of the officers dispersed,
going to their respective stations.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span><h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>Middle Tennessee and Kentucky.</span></h2></div>

<p>On reflection, I find that I omitted about a year’s
service in Tennessee and Kentucky, before my capture
near Bowling Green and will insert this now.</p>

<p>After destroying trestles and bridges between
La Vergne and Nashville, under General Forrest,
and capturing a railroad train at La Vergne, on
which Colonel Fordyce was captured, we were ordered
back across the mountain to Chattanooga,
where we commenced scouting and picketing on the
Tennessee River. We frequently extended our
scouts almost to Guntersville, with the Federal
Army massing and camping just across the river.
General Mitchell commanded at Huntsville. He
gave out that he was building a gunboat, with
which to capture Chattanooga, and had the people
of Chattanooga badly alarmed about it, but when
finally he got his gunboat ready to move up the
river, a scout of about twenty Texas Rangers were
sent down to meet it with shotguns, taking a position
on top of a high bank, opposite the mouth of
Battle Creek, which was in plain view of this high
bank. The gunboat approached and proved to be
an ordinary small river boat, lined with cotton bales
on the edge of the decks with the troops aboard,
lying around carelessly on the side of this barricade
of cotton bales, some of them playing cards. When
the boat came very close to our bluff, we turned
loose our shotguns on them and drove the boat into
the mouth of Battle Creek, where it remained and
was utilized by the Federal Army as a bridge for
crossing the creek. This proved the end of General
Mitchell’s famous gunboat, with which he threatened
to capture Chattanooga. It was driven out of
commission by Terry’s Rangers’ shotguns and relieved
the people of Chattanooga of their anxiety.</p>

<p>While picketing down on the river road with a
companion, we stopped at a blacksmith’s shop near
Nicajack Cave and had our horses shod; just across
the river was a camp of Federal infantry and artillery.
The river at this point we judged to be about
three-quarters of a mile wide, perhaps more; the railroad
continued to run on the banks of the river, after
passing the Narrows with the first depot out of Chattanooga,
Shell Mound. After having our horses shod
we rode down to the railroad on the banks of the
river, the grade of which was high enough to protect
us and our horses. We discovered a soldier at the
river, filling some canteens and to see him run, we
fired our pistols across, which of course made him
run to his camp. Soon after, we heard the artillery
bugle and immediately a gun opened on us with
shell, which always struck the Nicajack Cave, some
three-quarters of a mile in our rear, the country between
us and Nicajack Cave being flat and open. We
soon moved down to the little brick depot at Shell
Mound and opened on them from there, when they
perforated it with their shells; we then moved down
to a box bridge across the mouth of the creek running
into the river and had them make that a target.
It is hardly necessary to say that we enjoyed this,
somewhat, having a duel with our pistols against
their piece of artillery. We were entirely protected
and didn’t consider that we were under any
danger whatever of being hit.</p>

<p>While picketing on this main road, General Morgan
ran down on a locomotive as far as Shell Mound,
just before our escapade with this artillery and
came very near having his engine struck by a shell,
but he succeeded in getting back to Chattanooga
with his locomotive.</p>

<p>We were soon ordered back to Middle Tennessee,
under General Forrest, where we operated around
McMinnville, Manchester and along the railroad.
After an attack on the outskirts of Manchester one
morning, which Colonel Forrest decided was too
strong for us, we withdrew further down the railroad,
where we charged a block-house, the first we
ever attempted to capture and the first we had ever
seen. But, although some of our men got right up
to the house, we were unable to force them to surrender,
and were forced to give it up as a bad job.
While engaged in this venture, a large force of infantry,
cavalry and artillery had moved out on the
road from McMinnville and were about to cut off
our line of retreat. When we got in sight of this
force, hurrying to get out of this corner, they raised
a shout, which I must say made me feel very uncomfortable,
knowing that they outnumbered us perhaps
five to one, but we succeeded in dashing across
the main road, where we wheeled and charged their
advance column, bringing them to a halt, permitting
others of the command to cross, that were virtually
cut off, but they did capture a large fine looking
negro man, who was the servant of General Forrest.
His name was Napoleon, and he was devotedly
attached to General Forrest. In connection with his
capture they also captured two fine horses belonging
to the general. They carried this negro to Louisville
prison and did their best to persuade him to take
the oath of allegiance and join them, but he steadfastly
refused, as he was devotedly attached to General
Forrest and was finally, through some special
arrangement, exchanged and returned to the general.
The last I knew of him I heard of him in
Louisville prison, when he was sent around for exchange.</p>

<p>After operating a while longer in Middle Tennessee
without any important captures, we got information
that General Bragg had crossed the Tennessee
River at Chattanooga and was moving across
Cumberland Mountain, driving the Federal Army
before him and we were instructed to harass the
enemy as much as possible. In accordance therewith
we would attack their infantry (moving with
their artillery, ordnance and wagon trains by divisions
on several of the main roads). We would dash
into their rear, forcing them to stop and draw up
in line of battle, when they would commence shelling
us and we would move out of the range of their
artillery rapidly, further up the road, striking another
column perhaps in flank, leaving the first mentioned
column shelling the woods for an hour or
more after we had left. In this manner we kept them
harassed and impeded their rapid movements,
while General Bragg, with the main army, was moving
as rapidly as possible on their flank, crossing
the Cumberland River higher up on his way to
Glasgow, Kentucky. The Federal Army made a
short stop at Nashville, collecting all their forces,
and then moved from there towards Mumfordsville,
Kentucky, on Green River.</p>

<p>While in pursuit of one of these Federal columns
on top of a mountain not far from Woodbury, we
struck a point on the pike where it was built across
a deep ravine; the crossing protected on the side by
a rail fence. Just as we entered the narrow point
in this lane, General Forrest, who was riding in
advance of our regiment, discovered a vidette of
the enemy in the woods on the far banks of the
ravine, and he immediately had some men dismounted
on both flanks, to drive them in, satisfied
that the enemy were going to make a stand on the
other side of the ravine. He determined to charge
them, horseback, for which purpose we formed fours
and prepared for the charge by tightening our saddle
girths. Just as we were ready to move on them,
a masked battery of four pieces opened on us and
drove us back, as we stood no chance of reaching
it in massed formation of fours through this narrow
lane on the Pike.</p>

<p>The first shell cut off a leg below the knee of
D. Rugeley, one of the finest looking young men
we had in the company, and one of the best. He
was held on his horse by his companions, on our
retreat, when the enemy’s cavalry charged us and,
for the moment, created a little confusion. When
Colonel Wharton discovered Rugeley’s plight, holding
the lower part of his leg by the foot and being
assisted by a comrade on each side, holding him on
his horse, he was completely overcome with the
sight, rode up and fell over on D., with both arms
around his neck, crying, when D. said to him,
“Colonel Wharton, this is no place to take on in this
manner. Leave me and save yourself.” This
aroused Wharton and wheeling his horse, called on
the Rangers to rally and drive back that cavalry
and save D. Rugeley, which it is hardly necessary
to say, was done in short order. This is perhaps
the only instance where Colonel Wharton was seen
to lose control of himself and can only be explained
by the fact that D. Rugeley’s father and he were
most intimate friends, and on parting with Rugeley’s
father had been enjoined to take special care
of his boy.</p>

<p>An instance of appreciation of our services was
illustrated near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, through
which place we had just passed in pursuit of a large
Federal column. In passing through a lane a few
miles north of town, where a number of ladies had
congregated to see us pass, an old lady among them
was cheering us and clapping her hands, when she
was heard to remark, “Oh, daughter; just look at
our soldiers, grand men as they are, all covered
with dust so they can hardly be recognized; God
bless them! I wish they could stay long enough
so I could wash their clothes.” This old lady perhaps
had never seen a washtub in her life, as judging
from the magnificent house which appeared
through the woods, and its surroundings, she was no
doubt raised in wealth and affluence. It was such
expressions as this, on the part of the ladies, that
made us good soldiers.</p>

<p>After our army reached Glasgow the enemy had
concentrated a strong force at Mumfordsville, which
was strongly fortified and which they determined
to hold at all hazards. Nashville was not evacuated
by them, but a force of ten thousand men, strongly
fortified, with Andrew Johnson, demanding of General
Nelson to hold this place at all hazards, which
was done. While our army was at Glasgow, which
was only about twenty-five miles from Bell Station,
McDonald, a member of our company, proposed to
me to go by and see the Smith family, at whose
house he had been sick and to which I agreed, and
for this purpose called on Colonel Wharton to give
us a pass, which he refused, saying that no one could
be permitted to pass our lines unless they had a
pass from General Bragg, countersigned by General
Polk. We told him, “Colonel Wharton, we feel in
duty bound to visit these people,” and gave him
the reason, telling him that we would make the
attempt without a pass. He said, “Graber, if you do
and you are caught, Bragg will have both of you
shot.” I told him, “All right; catching before
hanging.” We started out at night, telling him
“If you miss us you’ll know where we are.” We
started out the main road towards Bell Station; when
about a mile we struck an Alabama picket and asked
the lieutenant commanding to allow us to pass
through, telling him the circumstances that prompted
our determination to visit our friends. He
said, “Rangers, you know we would do anything
we can for you, but our orders are very strict and
we cannot disobey them.” We then moved back out
of sight, struck out into the woods on their flank,
passing around them and made our way to the
Smith home, about four miles from Bell Station. It
is hardly necessary to say the old lady and her
daughters, the only ones left at home, were delighted
to see us, and especially to hear from the army.
They had not heard from their boys, who were in
Breckenridge’s Brigade, nor their father, who was
with them. It will be remembered he left his home
with McDonald in a wagon and carried him to Bowling
Green, when he was convalescent from his spell
of pneumonia. We remained at the house nearly
a half day, when we heard heavy firing at Mumfordsville
and immediately mounted our horses and
started for there.</p>

<p>Arriving at Mumfordsville about night I was
unable to get any information of our brigade and
we decided to go into the battle with the infantry
the next morning, but during the night the Federals
surrendered. About daylight we mounted our
horses and entered the fort through an embrasure
and soon struck the hospital tents, where McDonald
dismounted to try to find some liquor. While I
never indulged in strong drink, it was hard to keep
McDonald from it. While holding his horse, waiting
for him to come back, Colonel Wharton rode in,
at the head of our regiment, from the opposite
side of the fort from where we had entered and on
seeing me, simply said, “Hello, Graber; you beat us
in,” and smiled. I expect we were the first Confederates
inside of the fort. It seems that General
Chalmers, the evening before, had made a determined
attack on the works and was repulsed with
heavy loss. The colonel commanding the fort, learning
that General Bragg had arrived with the whole
army, completely surrounding him during the night,
decided it was better to surrender than to risk another
engagement the next day, as he had only about
four or five thousand men.</p>

<p>After leaving Mumfordsville, our cavalry and
Forrest continued on the main road through Elizabethtown
and on to Bardstown, Kentucky, out of
which place we drove the Federal cavalry. They retreated
to Louisville. We were camped at Bardstown
several days, awaiting the arrival of the infantry
and while there, formed the acquaintance
of a number of good people, which means friends
of the South. At Bardstown we found the home
of Judge Newman, whose daughter, the wife of my
old friend, Cannon, then lived at Courtney. Before
they had removed from Hempstead, a year or more
before the breaking out of hostilities, her sister,
Miss Josie Newman, made a visit to Hempstead,
where she formed the acquaintance of quite a number
of young men that were in the army with us.
On our second day’s sojourn a Mr. Tom Clay, belonging
to Company K of our regiment, whose home
was in Washington County, and who had been intimately
acquainted with Miss Josie during her stay
at Hempstead, proposed to me to call on Miss Josie,
to which I agreed. Alighting in front of their house,
Miss Josie happened to be standing in the door and
recognizing us, rushed to the gate and invited us in.
Just then a little boy came along and asked me to
give him a little silk Confederate flag some young
ladies had presented me with the day before and I
had sticking in the browband of my horse’s bridle.
Fearing the little boy would take the flag while we
were in the house, I suggested that I had better take
this in with me. Miss Josie then said, “That flag
can’t come into our house.” Up to this time we
were unaware that they were Union people. My
friend, bowing to her, said, “We will certainly not
go into a house where our flag is not welcome,” and
we declined to go in. By this time her mother had
come to the gate, when Miss Josie introduced us.
Mrs. Newman having heard my name, through the
Cannon family, quite often, she insisted on our
coming in, when we told her Miss Josie’s objections.
She chided her for her discourtesy and told us
to come in and bring the flag, when my friend said
to Miss Josie, “We will compromise the matter with
you and go in, if you will sing Dixie and Bonnie
Blue Flag for us,” which of course she had to agree
to do and, while singing these songs, I sat at the
end of the piano with my little Confederate flag
in my hand and when she sang the chorus I would
wave the flag.</p>

<p>After two days’ sojourn we moved on up towards
Louisville, part of our force dividing and occupying
the town of Taylorsville on our right; the
balance of the command camping near Mount Washington
on the Bardstown Pike. Here General Forrest
received an order from the War Department to
personally report to Richmond and turn the command
of the brigade over to Colonel Wharton. In
about a week the Federal forces advanced out of
Louisville. They were said to be a hundred thousand
strong, while another force moved out of
Cincinnati, about sixty thousand strong, with a view
of cutting us off from retreat to Cumberland Gap.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span><h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>Bardstown Engagement—I “Swap” Horses With a Federal.</span></h2></div>

<p>The object of General Bragg’s advance into Kentucky
was to form a nucleus for Kentuckians to
rally around, our War Department having been
importuned by leading Kentuckians to do this,
claiming they would have a hundred thousand men
to join us as soon as we could reclaim their territory.
On this point, however, they were mistaken, as we
gathered only about six thousand recruits and they
all wanted to serve in cavalry. They joined us
largely about half equipped for cavalry service,
many of them with citizen’s saddles and shotguns
or squirrel rifles and, while on the subject, I might
mention here that over half of them deserted us before
we passed through Cumberland Gap and soon
after they found that we were unable to hold Kentucky.
Gen. Bragg moved in there with about thirty
thousand men, exclusive of General Kirby Smith’s
force of about twelve thousand, which moved on
Cincinnati and fought the battle of Richmond, where
they completely defeated the Federal Army of about
twenty-five thousand strong, capturing, killing and
wounding nearly half, with the balance driven into
Covington and Cincinnati.</p>

<p>While at Bardstown, General Bragg, finding that
the real object of his campaign was a failure, decided
to turn it into a raid; to collect valuable
stores and move out again, through Cumberland
Gap.</p>

<p>When Colonel Wharton took command of the
brigade, succeeding General Forrest, General
Wheeler with another brigade occupied the Taylorsville
Pike, both brigades holding the enemy in check
in their advance as best they could. Our little force
at Taylorsville was drawn over to the Bardstown
and Louisville Pike, where they met the balance of
the brigade at Mount Washington. While at Mount
Washington, drawn up in line, eating our lunch, a
large force of Federal cavalry made a dash on us
but were soon repulsed and driven back. In this
engagement a messmate of mine, Roland Chatham,
received a pistol ball right in the center of his forehead,
just over the eyes, the ball penetrating his
skull and burying itself in the brain. This however,
did not knock him off his horse and he remained
with us until after the enemy was driven back.
Passing to the rear with his wound bleeding, he
was noticed by some ladies in Mount Washington,
displaying his pistol, when they were heard to remark,
“Just look at that poor Texas Ranger; shot
through the head and still he wants to fight.” In
this connection I would state that Chatham was sent
to the hospital and finally to Texas, never having
been completely disabled on account of this wound,
and with this ball imbedded in the brain, lived to a
good old age, dying only a few years ago at Bryan,
Texas, where he raised a large family. Here he
started and operated a cotton gin manufactory,
which proved a great success and enabled him to
amass a considerable fortune. During all his lifetime
his wound remained open but never affected
his mind. This was, perhaps, one of the most remarkable
cases on record.</p>

<p>The Federal advance through Mount Washington
and Taylorsville continued daily as soon as it
was light enough to discern anything. The enemy’s
skirmishers would advance and, supported by their
line of battle and artillery, would drive us from
positions we had taken up. We would then fall back
to another good position, perhaps a mile, and defend
that as best we could, again to be driven from it in
the same manner. I forgot to mention we had with
us in this brigade, the First and Second Georgia and
the Tennessee Battalion, under Colonel Baxter
Smith, who is still living at Nashville, Tennessee.</p>

<p>When within nine miles of Bardstown, one morning
(dark and drizzling rain) the enemy failed to
make its appearance at daylight. Waiting until
about nine o’clock, Colonel Wharton got suspicious,
and sent a scout in our rear, who struck a large
cavalry force of the enemy of about eight regiments,
occupying the pike near the Fair Grounds. Returning,
full speed, the scout reported to Colonel Wharton
this condition. Immediately placing himself at
the head of our regiment, drawn up immediately
across the pike, Colonel Wharton sent couriers to
the balance of our regiment and to a section of little
brass six-pounders (originally the property of the
Arkansas Military Institute) commanded by Captain
Pugh of our regiment, a western Texas cowman,
instructing them to come on and catch up with our
regiment as fast as they could. Wharton at the
head of the regiment in column of fours, struck a
lope and soon arrived in sight of this body of the
enemy’s cavalry. He then ordered a charge and
when at a junction of a dirt road with the pike,
about two companies of this cavalry formed in an
orchard behind a rail picket fence, which are rails
stuck in the ground, picket fashion, and fired on
our flank point blank. About thirty or forty of us
turned on them, halting in front of this picket fence
with our bridle reins thrown over the horns of our
saddles, and with a six-shooter in each hand, began
to empty saddles. This caused them to break and enter
a lane in their rear, having already let down the
fence to provide for such an emergency, and fled
up the lane in a northerly direction from whence
they had come. Colonel Wharton with the balance
of the regiment dashed into the solid body of the
enemy in his front and scattered them. It soon developed
that they were panic stricken and were
driven over the open country, interspersed only by
rail and rock fences, in detached bodies of twenty
and fifty, and so on, by only a few Rangers, driving
them like cattle on the prairies. Here was one of
the most brilliant cavalry engagements we were
ever in and resulted in our capturing a great many
prisoners.</p>

<p>When the regiment passed through Bardstown
somewhat hurriedly, passing by the Newman residence,
Miss Josie Newman, who was standing at the
gate, watching them go by, saw a Major Jared Gross,
a former acquaintance, loping up the column. She
recognized him, clapping her hands and calling out,
“Good-bye, Jared; I’m glad to see you running,”
when the next moment she recognized a Federal,
Major Watts, riding behind one of our boys, a prisoner,
his face badly bruised and his clothes torn and
soiled, having had his horse killed under him. This
sight immediately brought her tears and she went
back into the house, crying. She was a kind hearted,
good young lady, full of spirit in her Union
sentiment.</p>

<p>Now, to go back to the party of Federals in the
orchard, fleeing up the lane from the direction
whence they came: Captain Mark Evans, commanding
one of our Western companies, and I, were the
first ones to enter the lane and drive these fellows.
We were followed by quite a number of others, who
stopped at the fence with us when first fired into.
In running up the lane we ran over a number of
six-shooters and belts with sabre and six-shooters
attached. The six-shooter was always a valuable
capture for us, as we could readily sell it to men
in the army who had money, which we were always
in need of, and although we were virtually maintaining
ourselves without the aid of the Government,
we could not afford to stop and pick up these pistols,
as everything depended on crowding these Federals,
who outnumbered us at least ten to one; but, as
before stated, they were panic stricken, which sometimes
happened to the best of troops.</p>

<p>After passing about a mile up this lane, I noticed
a very fine pistol. I recognized it as a Tranter, an
English pistol, self-cocking, of which Colonel Terry
had four, and I was always anxious to secure a pair
of them. My first impulse was to stop and get this
pistol; then again concluded not to stop, as so much
depended on our crowding them, but, after passing
it perhaps thirty or forty yards, I decided I would
go back and pick it up, anyway. For this purpose,
I wheeled and as my horse’s position was across the
lane, in turning, one of our men just behind me,
struck my horse’s neck and broke the headstall of
my bridle, dropping the bit out of the horse’s mouth.
He wheeled and ran after Evans and the Federals,
running faster than ever I had known him to
run before, and he would soon have carried me
right in among them. But, when near Evans I called
to him to stop my horse; at the same time one of
the Federals dismounted from his horse and surrendered.
He and Evans together stopped my horse,
and as there was no time for swapping bridles, I
slipped over on his horse, handing him my bridle
rein which was still around my horse’s neck with
the bit attached; grabbing his pistol, I went on my
Federal horse and told the Federal to wait and turn
mine over to some of the boys behind.</p>

<p>Continuing up this lane we discovered a bunch of
about twenty-five or thirty, some hundred and fifty
yards to our right, in a field, headed by an officer
riding a magnificent horse and in magnificent uniform.
We soon arrived at a big gate on our right,
just beyond where another fence connected with the
lane fence, this fence running due east, and which
this bunch of Federals had to cross. When we
reached this gate Evans said to me, “Run through
that gate and head off this bunch,” which I did.
I forgot to mention that this party was driven by
only about a half dozen of our men. After passing
through the gate I stopped, took position almost immediately
in front of them and when the officer got
near the fence I threw my pistol down on him and
demanded his surrender, to which he paid no attention,
but threw off the top rail, the rider of the
fence, and made his horse leap the fence, passing
right in front of me, running through an orchard
and I have never been able to understand how he
succeeded in avoiding the limbs of the trees without
butting his brains out.</p>

<p>When the balance of his men came up and attempted
to jump the fence, the first man broke it
down and furnished an easier way for the balance
to cross but, being headed off by me, they were
forced to take right down the fence east, followed
by our boys, whom I cautioned several times to
hold their fire until the Federals would bunch up.
To this, however, very little attention was paid and
with my additional pistol, my shots held out longer
than theirs.</p>

<p>Now, it must be understood that having to load
our pistols with loose powder from the powder flask,
which had a gauge attached, then ramming down
the ball with a ramrod attached to the pistol, then
putting a cap on the nipple, it was necessary to
stop and reload, as an attempt at reloading, running,
would have spilled the powder and caused
confusion; hence, one after another of our boys
dropped behind to reload. This found me alone, just
after the Federals and I had turned the corner of
a stone fence, starting due north again. When
about a hundred yards from this stone fence I
fired my last shot, when one of them looked around,
discovered I was by myself, called on the others
to “turn on him; there is only one by himself; give
him h—.” I wheeled and the Yankees wheeled.
When we had run back only about fifty yards, two of
our men, who I think were Geo. W. Littlefield and
Beardy Miller, turned the same corner of the stone
fence. When this bunch of Federals saw this, they
again wheeled, running north. When Littlefield
and Miller came up to where I was they said, “Come
on; come on.” I said, “No, I have got to stop and
load my pistol,” which I proceeded to do, they continuing
after this bunch of Federals. Having about
three or four chambers of my pistol filled with powder
and standing about fifteen yards from the fence,
seven more Federals came around the same corner
of the fence, running between me and the fence,
after I had drawn back my horse about ten steps,
giving them more room. If I had had one load in
my pistol, I would have demanded their surrender,
which I believe they would have done, but they
never said a word to me nor I to them, and went
flying after Littlefield and Beardy Miller, who were
after the first bunch.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that before we had reached
this far, we heard heavy firing of infantry and artillery.
We knew it was infantry by their first volley;
then a very rapid, scattering fire, as also rapid
cannonading in the direction of the Fair Grounds,
which we concluded to mean that the balance of our
brigade were passing down into Bardstown, around
this infantry and artillery, which had been sent in
support of their cavalry.</p>

<p>After having completed the loading of two of my
pistols, I discovered a bunch of about eighty or a
hundred Federals running towards me, cut off by
the long fence running east. When they struck the
fence, in place of crossing it, continuing in their
course north, they turned right down the line of
fence east, on the south side of it. By this time
the firing at the Fair Grounds had become more
scattered and distant, and the artillery had ceased
firing, but I was afraid to venture back the way I
came, by myself, therefore, decided that I would
let down the fence, getting on the south side of it,
follow this last bunch east, until I was about four
or five miles east of Bardstown, then turn due south
and strike the Springfield Pike, on which I knew our
infantry were moving from Bardstown to Perryville.
I finished loading my pistols, then crossed the fence
and started east in the wake of these Federals, keeping
a sharp lookout ahead and, after riding about
three or four miles, passing through woods-lots and
fences, I emerged from the woods, up on a ridge, and
discovered these fellows about a quarter of a mile
below me in a field, drawn up in a line, facing in
my direction. I resorted to a ruse, taking off my
hat and waving it behind me, then started at them,
but this would not work and immediately they started
after me. I turned south and put my Federal
horse to his best and soon got out of sight.</p>

<p>Having run in this direction some three or four
miles, coming out of a woods-lot through a big gate
to a large, white house I stopped and called, hoping
to get some information about the best way to get to
the Springfield Pike. After calling some little time,
an old gentleman came out of the door, to the front
porch, when I called to him that I was a Confederate
soldier and wanted some information about striking
the Springfield Pike, four or five miles east of
Bardstown. Having heard the firing of the infantry
and artillery, which no doubt greatly alarmed him,
he talked so fast and rambling that I was unable to
understand him, and I begged him to come to the
gate, which he started to do. When about half way,
I heard the woods-lot gate creak, looked around
and here were my Federals, coming single file, which
of course started me again, running south into a
short lane running east, and when at the mouth of
this lane, only about three hundred yards long, I
looked across the corner of this man’s field and
found about a dozen or more of these fellows bunched
up at his gate, talking to the old man. I immediately
turned south again, putting my horse to
his very best. When about three miles from there,
I struck a lane with a dirt road running towards
Bardstown. I kept a sharp lookout for the Federals
behind me, whom I never saw again and don’t believe
they followed me any further. Looking up
the lane east, I discovered five Confederate cavalrymen
coming in the direction of Bardstown and when
they got up to where I was waiting for them in the
lane, having crossed the fence, I found that they
were three Georgians and two of our own regiment.
I then tried to get them to go back with me, telling
them that I believed that we could pick up quite
a number of prisoners, but the Georgians were unwilling;
they too, had heard the firing at Bardstown
and did not think it safe for us to go back in the
direction of where I left these people scattered over
the different fields.</p>

<p>I now suggested we strike south again until we
reached the Springfield Pike, which we did in due
time and struck Anderson’s Division of Infantry,
reporting to General Anderson our engagement and
telling him I was satisfied we could pick up many
prisoners if he would only send back with me a
couple of companies of cavalry. He stated he did
not have a man to spare and was unable to do so,
but told me to wait there, that General Hardee
would come up pretty soon and might act on my
suggestion.</p>

<p>In about half an hour General Hardee, with his
staff, came up, and I reported the engagement to
him and found he had had no particulars. Being
unable to tell him whether the balance of the brigade
with the two little popguns had got through safely
to Bardstown, made him somewhat apprehensive,
but he was, nevertheless, gratified to know that the
Rangers had come through all right.</p>

<p>General Hardee, in response to my request to
send some cavalry with me to pick up these stragglers,
said that he did not have a man to spare and
told me we had better stay at his headquarters that
night. The next morning we would find our command
at a certain point on this pike, he said. This
we decided to do, being very hungry and tired.
The next morning we started for our camp and, on
my arrival there, found my horse with the saddle,
everything all right, but no one in the company
could tell who delivered him or where he came from.
Captain Evans, I suppose, being too much engaged
in collecting his scattered forces, had not made any
report on my exchange of horses. I never found out
what became of my good Federal who held him for
me and swapped with me. My comrades, who had
concluded that I was perhaps killed, shot off of
my horse, had given me out and, when I rode in
on my Federal horse with the Federal overcoat and
other equipments, you can imagine their surprise.</p>

<p>Miss Josie Newman, just before Major Gross
passed her house, had called to some members of our
company to know where I was and their answer was
that I was left on the field, either dead or wounded
and this caused her and her mother, with friends,
to look over the field for several days, hunting me
or my body, so Mrs. Cannon reported after a visit
to her home, several years after the war.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span><h2>CHAPTER XV.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>The Battle of Perryville.</span></h2></div>

<p>Referring back to the balance of the brigade we
left formed on the pike, nine miles from town:
Couriers were sent them and to our little battery, to
follow us and catch up as fast as they could, which
they tried to do. When near the Fair Grounds
they fell into the enemy’s infantry and artillery
support, but successfully moved around them, losing
only a few killed and wounded and taken prisoners;
our loss in killed and wounded was very small.</p>

<p>The cause of our being cut off was through General
Wheeler, who had occupied the Taylorsville
Pike, moving into Bardstown the night before, sending
a courier to Colonel Wharton with a dispatch
ordering him to move in also. This courier was
captured, which of course, proved valuable information
to the enemy and on which they acted by throwing
this heavy cavalry, infantry and artillery forces
across our line of retreat.</p>

<p>This brilliant achievement of Wharton’s extricating
his brigade from this trap, secured his promotion
to that of Brigadier-General, the same as Forrest’s
exploit in the capture of Murfreesboro had secured
his commission as Brigadier-General.</p>

<p>After leaving Bardstown our army continued its
movement towards Perryville, its rear covered by
our cavalry, all under the command of General Joe
Wheeler. We pursued the same tactics that we did
between Louisville and Bardstown, taking up favorable
positions only to be driven from them by the
large force of the enemy, usually by their superior
artillery and heavy flank movements, thereby retarding
their advance and giving our infantry, artillery
and wagon train ample time to keep out of
their way, also enabling some part of the cavalry
to collect valuable army stores, such as provisions,
stock, etc.</p>

<p>At Perryville we were forced to call a halt and
give battle, our right wing, commanded by General
Polk, becoming actively engaged about two o’clock
in the evening.</p>

<p>The battlefield selected was one of the most favorable
to both armies that could have been wished
for, except that the extreme left wing of the Federal
Army was caught without water until they succeeded
in reaching a spring. Both lines of battle were
on wooded ridges, intervened by a gentle valley
from one and a half to three miles wide, these ridges
terminating not far from Doctor’s Creek where
there was considerable water, and which was commanded
by our lines. At the head of the valley another
wooded ridge sprang up about equidistant between
the terminations of the two first mentioned
ridges.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock we were ordered to our extreme
right, commanded by General Cheatham and
our line of march in the rear of the infantry line
was discovered by the enemy, causing a concentration
of their artillery to such an extent that we were
forced to drop to the rear out of their sight. Finally
we were ordered up on this wooded ridge commencing
in the center of the valley, as a corps of observation,
to watch the enemy’s extreme left and frustrate
any flank movements they might undertake.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that the artillery on both
lines opened about daylight and gradually developed
on both lines to about one o’clock, the infantry of
both lying down and keeping out of sight. While
on the ridge as stated, acting as a corps of observation,
General Wharton, with his field glass, discovered
a body of Federal cavalry, loaded with canteens,
at a spring at the foot of the mountain they
were occupying and called to the command, “About
a half dozen of you get off your horses and drive
that cavalry away from the spring.” As the mountain
or ridge we were on, on the side next to the
enemy, was very rocky and precipitous, the necessity
of dismounting was apparent. I, with five or
six others, obeyed the order and we were soon down
in the valley, charging this spring, when this cavalry,
with their long range Spencer rifles, took position
behind a rock fence and opened on us. We had only
one long range gun, in addition to six-shooters and
knowing that the eyes of our own command, as well
as Cheatham’s Division of infantry were watching
us, we never considered a halt, but charged right
on to them and, with our pistols, drove them away
from the spring. We followed them around the foot
of their ridge, past a house in the rear of the ridge,
then down a line of fence, while they passed into
the field and finally into a cedar thicket. We decided
that we had better retire. We had started to do so,
when one of these fellows came out of the thicket,
riding a gray horse and called to us, waving his
pistol. We turned loose on him with our pistols and
drove him back into the thicket. We again started
to retire, when he made his appearance again, pursuing
the same tactics, when one of our boys, who
had an Enfield rifle, the only gun in the party, crept
down the outside line of the fence, unseen by them,
until about even with the thicket and when the fellow
made his appearance again, the third time, he
fired on him, tumbling him off his horse. This brought
a shout from our party, when simultaneously with
our shout, a battery opened on the extreme left of
the ridge, almost right over us, but they were not
shooting at us. Still we knew unless we hurried out
of there, we would be caught, and immediately proceeded
to do so. When we got in sight of the ridge
occupied by our cavalry, we discovered the object
of their artillery fire, which was shelling a party
General Wharton had sent around, leading our
horses, to bring them to us. Before we got half
way across we found our regiment sweeping around
the foot of the mountain, across the valley, up on
the enemy’s ridge and as soon as they were out of
sight in the dense woods on the ridge, they fell into
the enemy’s infantry behind a stone fence, which
poured volleys into them and it is hardly necessary
to say, badly scattered them, and they left a number
of killed and wounded on the field. In the meantime,
General Cheatham and staff had been seen
crossing the valley to the point where our regiment
was engaged, followed by his strong line of infantry.
General Cheatham called to our scattered forces
to “take this cavalry out of here and let my people
take a hand,” which they did as soon as they got
within range of this stone fence. This fence was
defended by the enemy’s infantry at close quarters
with clubbed guns and bayonets, but they finally
yielded and were driven, inch by inch, off the mountain
to their rear. This was the opening of the
battle of Perryville and occurred about two o’clock
in the evening. Among the dead left temporarily
on the field was Captain Mark Evans, shot through
the center of the head. The reader will remember
that a few days before he saved my life and assisted
me in swapping horses with the Federal in the
Bardstown fight.</p>

<p>After rallying his forces General Wharton moved
around in the rear of this wooded ridge and, while
moving parallel with this ridge in the valley beyond,
discovered an ordnance train in a lane about a
quarter of a mile to our right, and prepared to
charge it. Immediately a battery of four pieces
opened on us on our flank, compelling us to withdraw,
as we were satisfied that this battery was
supported by a heavy force of infantry. Under this
fire of artillery we had a complete set of fours cut
down by one cannon ball or shell that passed
through the bodies of four horses, cutting off both
legs of one man below the knee, but not injuring
the three other men, who mounted behind other comrades
and rode off the field. This set of fours
was just in front of the set of which I constituted
a part and, on the spur of the moment, I stopped with
our wounded friend to assist him. When attempting
to hand him my canteen, to give him water, my
horse pulled back completely out of his reach, preventing
giving him water, which I could not throw
to him, as the stopper of the canteen was lost, when
Jared Gross, seeing our predicament, came back to
assist me. Our command, in the meantime, had gone
forward into a piece of timber, out of sight of the
artillery. When Jared rode up pretty close to me I
suggested that we had better keep apart as this
artillery had the range on us, and we had barely
separated when they fired another shot which cut
the side of the mountain and would certainly have
got us both if we had failed to separate. We were
compelled to leave poor Duncan on the field, where
he was afterwards attended by our surgeon and
taken to a house and left inside of the enemy’s lines
the next day. We never heard of him any more, assuming
that he died, as the shock was too great, in
connection with the loss of blood, for him to survive.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span><h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>I Refuse to Become a Teamster.</span></h2></div>

<p>While at Corinth, immediately after the battle of
Shiloh, we were ordered to furnish two wagon
drivers and called for volunteers, having two wagons
to the company. There was not a man in the
company that would agree to drive wagons and we
were instructed to draw lots, when, with my usual
luck, I drew lots to drive wagons, which was a
four-mule team; and I had never done any driving
before. The other party was Jared Gross, who also
objected to driving mules. I told General Wharton
that I didn’t leave my home and everything I had
to come out there and drive a mule team and that
I wouldn’t and couldn’t do so. He said, “Now,
Graber, you know you agreed to this drawing and
it is not right or fair for you to refuse.” I told him
that I knew it was mean, but I did not expect that
it would fall to my lot to drive this wagon, when he
finally told me, “If you do not obey this order I
will have to have you court martialed.” I told him,
“All right, Colonel Wharton, you may punish me
as much as you like, but I am not going to drive
that wagon.”</p>

<p>Some one then proposed to hire a couple of men
and pay them fifty dollars a month each, which
was done, and Duncan, with another man from Brazoria
County, whose name I have forgotten, volunteered
to take the job.</p>

<p>After crossing the Tennessee River at Lamb’s
Ferry, we left our wagons and considerable private
baggage with cooking utensils and tents, at Bear
Creek. A few days after, the Federal cavalry
crossed the river and captured the whole outfit, except
the men in charge of the same. This was the
last of our luxuries, tents, cooking utensils or
wagons never being issued after that, except to our
headquarters or the commanding general and his
staff, who employed Duncan to drive the headquarters
wagon.</p>

<p>Having been engaged in this, and fearing that the
war would end and he would have to go home and
report he had never been in any engagements, Duncan
decided that he must go into the battle of Perryville
with us, where he lost his life, as stated.</p>

<p>After our experience with the ordnance train
and battery, our command followed in the rear of
our infantry line, which slowly, but gradually, drove
the enemy until dark, capturing several batteries
of fine guns. By one of the batteries we found the
body of General Jackson, a Federal general from
Kentucky, who, when he found his infantry had
abandoned the battery, seemed determined to throw
away his life and, single and alone, dashed up to
one of our infantry men, cutting at him with his
sword, when the man shot and killed him.</p>

<p>After dark we tied our horses in the edge of a
woods, to a rail fence which enclosed a large corn
field, where the desperate fighting stopped. We
then went into the field and secured some corn for
our horses. As the most of the corn was destroyed
by the lines of battle, we had to pass over a good
deal of ground to get sufficient corn for our horses.
At the point where I stopped gathering, having secured
as many ears of corn as I could carry in my
arms, the dead lay so thick I believe I could have
stepped from one to the other within a radius of ten
or fifteen feet. Among them I noticed the dead body
of a magnificent looking man lying on his back with
his eyes open, seemingly looking at the starry firmament.
Noticing that he wore an officer’s suit, I turned
up his collar which disclosed two stars, denoting
his rank as lieutenant-colonel. I afterwards learned
that he commanded a Tennessee regiment in
Cheatham’s Division.</p>

<p>During the night an armistice was had by mutual
consent, for the purpose of taking care of the
wounded and burying the dead. We were ordered
to destroy the small arms left on the field, which
were very thick, by breaking the stocks on the trees,
which job we soon abandoned because many of the
guns were loaded. The batteries captured by our
people were exchanged for our own guns, as we
only had horses to carry off the number captured,
leaving our inferior guns spiked on the field.</p>

<p>The battle of Perryville, for the number engaged,
has always ranked as one of the most desperately
fought battles of the war, equal to Shiloh, Chickamauga
and others for desperate fighting, and which
the respective losses of the two armies fully sustained.</p>

<p>The battle of Perryville proved such a blow to
the Federal commander that it made him more cautious
in his rapid advance. Our infantry during
the night commenced their retreat with the wagon
train, artillery and everything belonging to them,
moving towards Harrodsburg, where we were met
by General Kirby Smith and his army, coming back
from Cincinnati. At this point we found a very large
amount of pickled pork in barrels, that had been
collected for removal with our army, but had to be
abandoned and was largely destroyed by our cavalry,
still covering the retreat, as heretofore.</p>

<p>The enemy at this point crowded us pretty close
and came very near forcing a general engagement
again, which no doubt would have proven disastrous
to our arms, because they outnumbered us at least
four to one. Our cavalry service continued to cover
the retreat except with occasional branching out to
different points where army supplies were stored,
notably Lebanon, where I was sent with a detail
of three others to a man’s house by the name of
Penick, who had a large plantation and owned a
great many negroes. He was said to have a great
deal of bacon, which we were instructed to have carried
to Lebanon. On arriving at the house I went
in and told the gentleman our business. He met
us in the hall, joined by his wife and daughter and
in answer to our demand that he have his negroes
hitch up his wagons and load the meat, he spitefully
told us that he had hid out his mules, negroes
and bacon and said, “Get it, if you can.” In reasoning
with him, trying to persuade him that we
would certainly find his hidden stuff, he became very
insulting, when I finally told him he was taking advantage
of us, knowing well that his gray hair and
the presence of the ladies would protect him from
our resenting his insults, but told him if he had any
boys to bring them out and we would settle the
matter with them pretty quick. He said, “I have
two boys, but they are in the army and if ever they
meet you, they will meet you like men.” I asked
him what branch of the service they were in, when
he told me they were in the cavalry. I then told
him that we had a cavalry fight a couple of weeks
before at Bardstown, where no doubt his boys were
engaged, when on his further enquiry about the engagement,
I told him how we scattered them all
over the country, killing and wounding a great
many. The ladies burst into tears and went back
into their room, and the old man had nothing more
to say about his boys.</p>

<p>I then again tried to persuade him to give us at
least one wagonload of bacon, promising him that
if he would send his team and a boy to drive it to
Lebanon, he would surely have them returned, when
he again refused in a spiteful, insulting manner. I
told him that we had understood he had some six
or eight yoke of work-oxen and in Texas we knew
all about handling oxen and we would go into his
pasture and drive them up and hitch them to the
wagons that were at the house, but this was only
a threat. We gave him up as a bad job and when
we reached the pike about three miles from there,
we met a citizen who told us that Wheeler’s cavalry
had evacuated Lebanon and burnt all the meat
stored there, which we were induced to believe, and
decided to ride back to the Harrodsburg Pike and
get with our command, which we did.</p>

<p>Our army then continued to retreat, the main
part of the army moving towards Crab Orchard,
where we struck the Cumberland Gap road, while
the army, under Kirby Smith, was struggling over
Big Hill, and had still to join the main army at the
junction of the roads at Pitman’s. The army then
moved into the mountains on the Cumberland Gap
road, which, owing to the character of the country,
was generally restricted to a single wagon track.
This stretched out our columns of retreat for perhaps
twenty miles or more and cut up the road
very badly, frequently causing wagons to stall. Two
infantrymen consequently were detailed with every
wagon, of which we had thirty-eight hundred, laden
with provisions and valuable stores. This detail of
two with each wagon was ordered to assist any
wagon that was stalled by taking hold of the wheels,
thereby helping the team to pull the wagon out of
the rut.</p>

<p>A division commander was detailed every day
to take charge of the wagon train and artillery and
keep it moving. When a wagon stalled, the whole
line of retreat, infantry, wagons and artillery behind
it, would have to wait until it would move
again, thereby seriously impeding our line of march
and causing the cavalry in the rear desperate fighting
sometimes to hold off the enemy.</p>

<p>It was reported of General Cheatham, when he
had charge of the train, that one of his wagons was
stalled, and he put spurs to his horse and rode up
the line and reached the wagon. The driver was
whipping his mules and the two infantrymen were
standing by the roadside, resting on their guns. At
the sight of this, he jumped off his horse, took hold
of the spokes of the wagon wheel and tried to turn
it, but all to no purpose. The two guards still stood
resting on their guns. General Cheatham lost his patience
and turned around and slapped one of the
guards in the face. This happened to be an Irishman,
who said, “Be God; if you were not Gineral
Cheatham you couldn’t do this.” General Cheatham
pulled off his sword belt, coat and hat and threw
them down by the side of the road and said, “Now,
there lies General Cheatham and here is Frank
Cheatham; now light in.” They say that at this
invitation the Irishman lit in and got the best of
the bargain, of which General Cheatham never made
any complaint. The two men then took hold of the
wheels in conjunction with General Cheatham, and
started up the wagon, and with that the whole line
of retreat.</p>

<p>This incident was currently reported and generally
believed by all who knew General Cheatham,
but I would not be willing to vouch for the same,
as it is almost past belief.</p>

<p>After leaving Crab Orchard, General Buell dispensed
with his cavalry, as they were unable to
cope with ours and moved only with his infantry
and artillery in advance. To enter into the details
of the rest of this campaign, would require too much
space and will only say that the brigade of General
Wharton, which always includes the Terry Rangers,
in conjunction occasionally with other cavalry, were
expected to and did succeed in retarding the pursuit
of the enemy, restricting his advance to from
six to eight miles a day only, thereby protecting our
infantry column, as well as the artillery, ordnance
and thirty-eight hundred wagons loaded with valuable
army stores. On this retreat the infantry were
called on only one time to fire a gun. We met the
enemy in a general engagement at Mount Vernon,
Barren Valley, Rocky Hill, Bushy Mound, Wild Cat,
Pitman’s Road, Little Rock, Castle River and many
other points, inflicting on them considerable loss.
This mountain service on the part of the Rangers
proved a most severe tax on their endurance, on
account of being deprived of rations. At one time,
for nearly two days, we depended on picking up
raw corn left in the camps of artillery and wagons,
where the horses and mules had been fed. A number
of times, after fighting all day long, we had to
go out into the hills ten or twelve miles to find
forage for our horses before we could retire to get
a little rest. Our camping places were frequently
by the light of the enemy’s fires.</p>

<p>To give the reader a better idea of the valuable
service we rendered, I will quote an order issued by
General Wheeler, read to us at Cumberland Gap,
October 23, 1862.</p>

your cheerful endurance in suffering from hunger,
fatigue and exposure, render you worthy of all

scarcely been for a moment without the range of the

you have successfully combated largely superior
numbers of the enemy’s troops of all arms. Hovering
continually near the enemy, you have engaged
in no less than one hundred skirmishes. Upon the
memorable field of Perryville, alone and unsupported,
you engaged and held in check during the entire
action, at least two infantry divisions of the opposing
army. By your gallant charges on that day
you completely dispersed and routed a vastly superior
force of the enemy’s cavalry, driving them in
confusion under their artillery and infantry supports,
capturing in hand-to-hand conflicts many prisoners,
forces and arms. Your continuous contact
with the enemy has taught you to repose without
fear under his guns, to fighting wherever found and
to quietly make your bivouac by the light of his
camp fires. On this continued series of combats and
brilliant charges, many great men have fallen. We
mourn their loss. We commend their valor. Let us
emulate their soldierly virtues.</p>

<span class='sc'>Omissions in Preceding Chapters</span></h2></div>

<p>After leaving Cumberland Gap our army again
moved into Middle Tennessee, with headquarters at
Murfreesboro. Our cavalry in the advance camped
near La Vergne, at Nolandsville and Triune. The
enemy concentrated at Nashville, from whence they
sent out foraging parties, supported by large infantry
forces with which we had daily engagements, restricting
their foraging within a small area of country.
At Nolandsville, where General Wharton made
his headquarters, we camped nearly a month, when
Lieutenant Decherd was instructed to select about
fifteen men and cross the Cumberland Mountain, for
the purpose of buying fresh horses, which were very
much needed. I was ordered to go with this party.</p>

<p>While camped near Winchester, Tennessee, intending
to cross the mountain the next day, we
heard the distant roaring of the guns of the battle
of Murfreesboro, which was not expected so soon
when we left the command, and which proved a
great disappointment to our party, as we felt that
every man was needed for such an event. We, therefore,
hastened back to the army, which we found
evacuating Murfreesboro, and reported. Of the
Rangers’ part in that great battle I will not mention
in this, as that is of record in the general reports
of General Bragg and others, and will only say
that they fully sustained their character as one of
the leading regiments in this army, capturing prisoners,
artillery, wagon trains, etc., and finally covering
the retreat of the army off the field.</p>

<p>Our army then continued its retreat through
Shelbyville to Tullahoma, our cavalry still operating
on the north side of Elk River. Before crossing Elk
River a courier reached General Wheeler from General
Forrest, after Wheeler had crossed the bridge,
requesting him to hold the bridge until he (Forrest)
could cross with his command. Promptly on receipt
of this information, General Wheeler, with a portion
of his command, notably the Fourth Alabama Cavalry,
recrossed the bridge to the north side, determined
to hold the same until General Forrest had
crossed with his command. Before Forrest reached
Shelbyville, however, General Stanley, with a heavy
force of cavalry, outnumbering Wheeler’s little force
ten to one, charged and forced them back across the
river, cutting General Wheeler off from the bridge.
General Wheeler spurred his horse to the bank and
over it, into the dangerous river, which had been
swollen by excessive rains, making a leap of not
less than twenty feet, with Stanley’s cavalry shooting
after him and continuously firing on him until
he reached the opposite bank. This was, perhaps,
the most miraculous escape he had during the war.</p>

<p>Before reaching Tullahoma, a Captain Gordon,
who had distinguished himself near Bardstown,
where he held in check a whole brigade of the
enemy’s infantry on the Bloomfield Road for a whole
day with only twenty men, was ordered to select
twenty men from the Rangers and enter Kentucky,
for the purpose of gaining information of the disposition
of the enemy’s forces, preparatory to a general
raid by our cavalry. The history of this trip,
which resulted in my being wounded and captured
and held a prisoner just one year, lacking a day, I
have already recorded, and by an oversight, it crept
into this history ahead of the proper time.</p>

<p>Recurring to the hard service sustained by us in
the mountains between Crab Orchard and Cumberland
Gap: The last night we were on picket duty our
company had dwindled down to seven men and I
happened to be on vidette with a messmate, John
Cochran. Just at daylight, when the enemy usually
made its appearance, we were relieved by two others
of the command and when we reached the reserve
picket, discovering a grassy spot in the middle of
the road, I told Cochran I must try to steal a little
nap, and laid down on this grassy spot, holding my
horse by the bridle, when I was awakened, only
about ten minutes after, by Cochran stooping down
from his horse and jabbing me with his pistol. The
reserve picket had formed a line across the road,
just a little back of where I was sleeping and were
firing on the enemy’s advancing skirmish line, the
noise of which failed to awake me and it was only
his prodding me with the end of his six-shooter that
got me awake. I had just time enough to swing on
to my horse and get out of there. Here Cochran’s
prediction, frequently made, that he would bet
Graber would wake up some fine morning with a
Yankee bayonet sticking in him, came very near being
verified. I merely mention this to give the reader
a fair idea of our complete exhaustion for the
want of sleep, continuous hunger and arduous duties.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span><h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>General Johnston’s Failure to Strike—Sherman</span></h2></div>

<p>Recurring to my service in Captain Britton’s
company, acting as escort to General Hood at Dalton,
Georgia, where I described the meeting of the
several generals with General Hood at his headquarters
in the rear of Railroad Gap: On our return to
camp that night after supper, Captain Britton suggested
he should go up to headquarters and pump
Major Sellars on the meaning of the meeting that
morning. He reported on his return from a visit to
headquarters that General Mower, commanding
Hooker’s old corps, had moved down to Snake
Creek Gap during the day, which was located about
nineteen miles in our rear and about ten miles west
of Dalton.</p>

<p>General Hood plead with General Johnston that
morning for permission to move out of his works
through Railroad and Rocky Face Gaps with his
corps and defeat Sherman’s Army before Mower
could return to reinforce them. Captain Britton
said that he would bet our army would be in full
retreat that night, falling back to Resaca, which prediction
was verified, as, by daylight next morning,
our infantry and artillery were engaged with the
enemy at Resaca, where we came very near losing
a large part of our army by having their retreat
cut off.</p>

<p>Had General Johnston yielded to General
Hood’s plan, there is no question but what he could
have destroyed Sherman’s Army; here was a golden
opportunity lost by General Johnston, and was
the beginning of the downfall of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>After about two weeks I succeeded in getting a
horse with the regiment and continued with the regiment
during the whole of the North Georgia campaign,
the details of which I will not venture to
insert, as they will be recorded fully in a history
now being written by Colonel Ben F. Weems of
Houston.</p>

<p>During the siege of Atlanta General Sherman
started out two cavalry expeditions, one under a
General Stoneman to move around the right wing
of our army, and one under General McCook around
the left wing of our army, both to unite on the
Macon line of railroad, and to destroy and tear up
the same, then move on to Andersonville and release
our prisoners. Had these expeditions proven
a success, with an army of probably twenty-five or
thirty thousand released prisoners turned loose in our
rear, it would have wound up the Confederacy. At
Atlanta, General Hood took command of our army,
not exceeding thirty-six thousand muskets and,
to use his words, “This army through General Johnston’s
retreating from Dalton, had become an army
of laborers by day and travelers by night,” while
the army at Dalton, including Polk’s corps at Rome,
numbered eighty-six thousand muskets, and was
better equipped and organized than any army the
West had ever had. The North Georgians and Tennesseans,
largely constituting this army, with their
families inside of the enemy’s lines, were anxious
and eager for an advance, and there is no question
of doubt had General Hood been permitted to give
battle at Dalton, our army would have recaptured
Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>

<p>Referring back to the enemy’s cavalry expedition
out of Atlanta: General Stoneman, with a large
part of his force, and a lot of convalescents in the
town of Macon, Georgia, were captured near Macon
by General Iverson, commanding Georgia cavalry.
General Wheeler with our brigade, Ross’ and Roddy’s,
forced McCook to a general engagement on the
evening of the second day between Noonan and Philpott’s
Ferry, where they finally surrendered, with the
exception of himself and staff, and Colonel Brownlow
and some other line officers, who swam the
river that night and made their escape.</p>

<p>General Wheeler issued an order that night for
no man to cross the river after these fellows, when
I, with several of our regiment, decided there must
be some mistake about it and crossed the river to
try to catch these fellows, specially anxious to capture
Colonel Brownlow. Immediately after crossing
the river we found a quartermaster’s clerk, so
he represented himself to be, left wounded at a
house. His wound, however, was not very serious
we thought. He had on a magnificent pair of boots,
which just about fitted me and I had been unable
to secure boots, only wearing shoes, when I proposed
to him to exchange with me, which he readily did.
While he was pulling off his boots, the lady of the
house came in and opened a tirade of abuse on me
for taking a poor, wounded man’s boots. I told her
I had but just come out of a Federal prison where
they treated us worse than that and I was satisfied
that my shoes would prove more comfortable to this
man at Andersonville, than the boots, to which our
prisoner agreed. We then continued our pursuit
on the main road to Wedowee, the county seat of
Randolph County, Alabama, occasionally taking a
prisoner, whom we would turn over to reliable citizens,
to be taken to West Point where we had a
garrison. We were unable to secure many prisoners,
probably not exceeding eight or ten, as those afoot
would hear us coming in the road and dart into the
brush, while their officers impressed every horse
they could lay their hands on and soon outdistanced
us with their fresh horses.</p>

<p>At Wedowee we found a tanyard, where I purchased
a lot of good leather, sufficient to rig a Texas
saddle. We had some men detailed to make saddles,
who were experts in such work and moved
down with the army as fast as it retreated. Our first
shop was at Ackworth, Georgia, where they did a
good deal of work, but were prevented from turning
out anything extensive ever after, for the reason
they were unable to get leather. I paid one hundred
and twenty-five dollars for the leather I got at this
tanyard. Colonel Harrison promised me, after my
return from prison, that if I would furnish the leather
he would have rigged for me one of the finest
saddles that could be made, which was the inducement
for me to carry this roll of leather on my
horse’s back.</p>

<p>Going back into the town from the tanyard, we
stopped at a hotel to get some dinner. This was one
of the ordinary country hotels with a porch in front
and large square columns under the porch. While
eating dinner, I had a seat at the end of the table
where I could see out on the street. The hotel was
located somewhat under the hill, away from the
square, when I discovered Carter Walker, one of
our party, who had finished dinner, behind one of
the posts with his pistol out, talking to some one
on the street towards the courthouse. Having his
pistol out suggested to me that there was trouble
ahead, so I jumped up and told the boys to come on.
As we got out on the porch we discovered about
fifteen or twenty men on their horses near the courthouse,
with one of them talking to Carter Walker,
about fifty yards distant from us. As soon as we
came out, he retired and when he got back with his
crowd, said something to them and immediately they
wheeled and left town. This proved to be a party
of bushwhackers, who were not anxious for a fight
with us. We now decided to return and when a few
miles from town, we heard of an old gentleman,
whose name I have forgotten, the only Rebel citizen
in that section, whom we decided to go and see and
get some information from.</p>

<p>After reaching his house and getting acquainted,
we decided, on his urgent request, to stay with him
that night, as we were very tired, as were also our
horses, and we did not suppose there was any great
need for our services immediately after the destruction
of the enemy’s cavalry. This old gentleman
had had considerable trouble with his Tory neighbors,
who came to his house several nights and
opened fire on him, which he, his old lady and his
daughter, a barefooted girl of eighteen, returned
with their squirrel rifles through port holes cut in
the logs of his house.</p>

<p>On the information of our old friend, we decided
to visit the house of a Tory neighbor of his, across
the mountain, who belonged to the Tory regiment
in camp at Rome, which we did. Riding up to the
house in blue overcoats, we called for a drink of
water, when a lady invited us in, supposing that we
were Federal soldiers. In our talk with them, there
being two other ladies in the house, we represented
that we were Federal spies on our way to Andersonville
to make arrangements about the escape of our
prisoners there, which created quite an interest with
these women, who told us that a large number of
young men of the neighborhood belonged to the
First Federal Alabama Cavalry, stationed near
Rome, and quite a number of them were expected
home pretty soon on a furlough. We then arranged
with them to tell their boys about our visit and tell
them that we expected to return there in about ten
days, as we would probably need their assistance
and we wanted to confer with them. Our idea was
that we would return there at that time, with our
company, and capture the whole outfit.</p>

<p>After making complete arrangements, we started
back towards Philpott’s Ferry, where we again recrossed
the Chattahoochie and, on our arrival at
Noonan, found that Wheeler had moved over to
Covington, on the Augusta road.</p>

<p>Riding all that day in a drizzling rain, we called
at a house for the purpose of getting some feed for
our horses and something to eat for ourselves. Night
had already set in. We asked the gentleman if he
could take care of us that night, give us a place to
sleep on the floor, as we never slept in a bed, and
get something to eat for our horses and ourselves.
His answer was, “Certainly, gentlemen; light and
come in.” I told him before we got off our horses
that we were about out of money and did not have
enough, perhaps, to pay our fare, when he stated that
if his wife had anything left from supper we could
have it and he would give us some shattered corn
for our horses. We, of course, didn’t feel very comfortable
under such liberality, but decided to stay,
nevertheless, and sleep down in his barn, some distance
from the house.</p>

<p>While we were waiting for his wife to gather
what she had left from supper, he asked us if we
were that command the other day that fired on the
Federals when they were tearing up the railroad
near his house. I told him that we were, and he
said, “They were in my pasture trying to catch my
horses, when they heard the guns fire and you ought
to have seen those devils run.” When we went
in to supper we found a little piece of cornbread and
a little butter, all they had left from supper, so the
woman stated, not enough to satisfy one man’s hunger.
We did not sit down at the table, didn’t touch
anything they had to offer us, and went down to the
crib to get the shattered corn for our horses, which
he consented for us to take, fed our horses and laid
down to rest for the balance of the night. Next
morning we got up early and without going to the
house, proceeded on the road towards Covington.
Here now, was a fair illustration of the want of
appreciation of a Confederate soldier, with a selfish
lot of people, whom we occasionally met. Rest
assured it was very discouraging to us. The idea of
coming all the way from Texas to fight for and protect
these people! He had told us that we saved his
horses from capture by engaging the enemy near
his house; you can imagine our disgust at such treatment.
We now proceeded on the Covington road.
When about two miles from there we came to a
large, white house, a magnificent place, and rode
up to the gate. A man about twenty-five years old,
well dressed, wearing a white starched shirt, the
first we had seen in a long time, came out to the
gate. When within twenty feet of us, espying the
leather on my horse’s back, tied to the rear of the
saddle, he called out, “I want that leather.” I
said, “If you need it any worse than I do, you are
welcome to it.” He said he did, he wanted to make
shoes out of it. I told him that I wanted to make
a saddle out if it, to ride to keep Federals off of
him, when he insisted that he needed it worse. I
then told him that we wanted some breakfast and
some feed for our hoses. He said, “All right, gentlemen;
light and come in.” Before getting down I
said, “I had better tell you that we are nearly out
of money, not enough to pay for breakfast and feed,
away from our command unexpectedly, but as soon
as we get with them and we have an opportunity,
we will send it to you.” He stated that he couldn’t
afford to feed us without pay, that the armies had
been around him for some time and had nearly
eaten him out of house and home. I told him that
he needn’t say anything more, that we didn’t want
anything he had, although our horses were hungry,
as well as ourselves. As we rode off he called
after us, “I’ll feed you for that leather,” thus adding
insult, but we decided not to notice him.</p>

<p>About three miles further down the road we
came to another house, a somewhat humble cottage,
and stopped to make some inquiry, when a lady came
out to the gate and we asked how far down the road
we could find a house where we could get something
to eat for ourselves and feed for our horses.
She asked us if we had tried at the big, white house
we had passed on the road. We told her that we
had and were refused because we had no money.
She then insisted that we come in and partake of
such as she had, telling us that she had very little
left, as the commissary from Atlanta had visited
her and taken all the corn she had, except five barrels,
which in Georgia, means twenty-five bushels.
This, she and her two daughters had made with their
own hands, her husband being in the Virginia army.
She then told us about this man at the big, white
house, who had never been in the army, but had
an exemption on pretense of working in a saltpetre
cave and had never had any forage taken by the
commissary from Atlanta, as he had protection
papers, so she called them, from his general at
Atlanta. I merely mention these cases to show
you the condition at that time, of the State of Georgia,
the worthy people submitting patriotically to
all manner of abuse by some of our army officials,
while some of the rich, through nefarious practices,
escaped the weight of war. Thanking this lady for
her kind offer, which we could not afford to accept,
we continued on this road and two miles further
on struck a large cornfield with tempting roasting
ears and decided to stop, build a fire, dry our clothes
and roast corn for our meal, feeding our horses
on the same, in moderation. We had to build our
fire of rails taken off the fence and very soon were
enjoying our roasting ears and the warm fire, being
somewhat chilled by the rain. The proprietor of the
place came up the road and, judging from his manner
and looks, was pretty mad, when he said, “Gentlemen,
if you had come to the house I would have
gladly given you a good meal and fed your
horses, rather than to see the destruction of my
rails.” I told him that we didn’t believe it, that we
had tried several places up on the road and were
refused because we had no money and he, no doubt,
noting that we were in no mood for argument,
decided that he had better say no more. We then
proceeded on our road to Covington. When on our
arrival there we found that Wheeler, with all the
cavalry having horses fit for service, had gone on
a raid into Middle Tennessee, by way of Dalton,
tearing up the railroad in Sherman’s rear for many
miles, and finally entering Middle Tennessee, returning
by way of Mussels Shoals, rejoining the
army below Atlanta.</p>

<p>After the battle of Jonesboro, Hood started on
his fatal Middle Tennessee campaign, his march to
the Tennessee River being covered by our cavalry,
making a feint at Rome, Georgia, to which point
General Sherman had followed, confidently expecting
to give Hood battle at Gadsden and never suspecting
his move towards the Tennessee River.
While concentrating his army at Rome, Harrison’s
Brigade, under Colonel Harrison, commanding our
regiment, made a feint on Rome by dismounting,
hiding our horses in the rear in the woods, out of
sight, and advanced on the outer works of Rome,
preceded by a line of skirmishers. For this purpose,
not having our battle flag with us, we used a
new flag, sent us from Nashville, made by a couple
of young ladies from their silk dresses, with the
name of Terry’s Texas Rangers worked in gold letters
and some Latin words on the other side. After
skirmishing with Sherman’s infantry a short time,
we retired down the valley, which at this point was
perhaps a couple of miles wide, from the hills to
the bottoms.</p>

<p>Falling back that night some six or eight miles,
we struck a wooded ridge, running from the hills
to the bottom, perhaps nearly three miles long.
This ridge overlooked the country in front towards
Rome, several miles. General Sherman coming out
in person with a corps of his infantry, expecting to
give Hood battle the next morning, discovered there
was only a handful of cavalry in his front, which
was Harrison’s Brigade, and which he was specially
anxious to capture. For this purpose he sent a
heavy cavalry force, perhaps three times our number,
into our rear, flanking our position by moving
through the hills on our left, then occupying nearly
every road in our rear, for eight or ten miles. During
the night we received reinforcements of Pillow’s
Brigade, a new command, which had been in only
one engagement, at La Fayette, Georgia, where they
were badly handled, causing the loss of a great
many killed and wounded and in consequence, they
were a little demoralized. We also received a section
of artillery, two pieces, under a lieutenant,
whose name I do not remember.</p>

<p>This artillery was stationed on a hill to the left
of our position, under an old gin house.</p>

<p>Immediately after taking position the artillery
opened on the enemy, a heavy line of battle making
its appearance in the edge of the woods, about a
mile distant. The Rangers were kept mounted,
drawn up near this old gin house, supporting the battery,
when all the rest of the two brigades had been
dismounted with their horses immediately in the
rear, out of sight of the enemy.</p>

<p>Very soon a courier from the right of our line,
dashed up to Colonel Harrison and reported that
the enemy were flanking us, down in the bottom,
with a heavy force. Harrison abused him, told him
to go back and tell his colonel if he sent him another
such message he would have him court martialed,
but very soon a lieutenant dashed up from the extreme
right of our line, reporting the enemy advancing
in the bottom, and about to outflank us,
when Colonel Harrison decided to ride down in the
rear of our line and ascertain conditions for himself.
Immediately the enemy raised a shout and charged.
The lieutenant of the battery, concluding that his
guns were in danger of being captured, limbered up
and ran down to the road, where he met Colonel
Harrison returning and was by him ordered to unlimber
and open again on the enemy, when he
succeeded in firing one shot and was sabered right
over his guns by the enemy’s cavalry. In the
meantime, through some misapprehension of orders,
the Alabama Brigade broke for their horses,
followed by the balance of our brigade, when our
regiment was ordered to charge their cavalry,
which we did, striking them on their flank, using
our six-shooters, to which they paid no attention,
simply calling out, “Clear the road for the Fourth
Regulars!” This Fourth Regulars was commanded
by a Captain McIntyre from Brenham, Texas, who
was in the United States Army, a lieutenant, when
the war broke out, having just graduated at West
Point.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that finding the
enemy’s cavalry in our rear for a great many miles,
resulted in a general stampede, everybody trying
to make their escape out of it. In recording this
engagement I regret to have to mention the loss of
our beautiful flag which, encased in a rubber cover,
slipped off its staff and was found by a Major
Weiler, commanding a battalion of the Seventeenth
Mounted Indiana Infantry, and after many years,
returned to us at Dallas, Texas, by Governor Mount
and staff, instructed to do so by a joint resolution
of the Indiana Legislature, in response to a memorial,
drawn up and sent by me.</p>

<p>In this engagement the Terry Rangers lost no
prisoners, had only a few wounded and none killed,
while the Alabamians’ loss was quite heavy in prisoners
and the balance of Harrison’s Brigade had
very few men taken prisoners. I made my escape
by crossing the big road, being joined by about
eight or ten Alabamians, one of whom was shot in
the fleshy part of the thigh, which somewhat demoralized
him, when he called on me, “Texas, can you
take us out of here?” I told him, “Yes, follow
me; I’ll take you out.” I struck out straight for the
river bottom, the Federal cavalry not following
us, and when out of sight of the main road, in a
little branch bottom, I called a halt and told the men
my plan of trying to swim the river, as the road
ahead of us seemed to be occupied for many miles,
judging by the scattered firing a great distance
ahead of us. The wounded man straightened
up in the saddle and asked me if I was an officer.
I told him, “No,” and he said that he was a lieutenant
and would take command of the squad. I
told him he could take command of his own men,
but he couldn’t command me, and told his men,
“Now, all of you boys that want to go out with me,
come on,” when they all followed me, including
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Reaching the high ground on the other side of
the branch, I discovered a house, with a lone cavalry-man
at the front gate, and, getting a little nearer,
I recognized him as one Joe Harris, of our company,
who was well acquainted in that section, having
married, near Cedartown, the daughter of a Doctor
Richardson, just on the other side of the river. He
suggested to me that he knew of a batteau about
seven miles this side of Rome; that we go up there,
put our saddles and equipments into the boat, swim
our horses across, then go to Doctor Richardson
and get a good dinner; to which I, of course, readily
consented. On our way to this batteau, following
the river in the bottom, we struck hundreds of
Alabamians trying to find a crossing place. These
men we took along with us and when we reached
the boat we were the first ones to cross, leaving
the Alabamians there to cross as fast as they were
able. Joe and I then rode to Doctor Richardson’s,
about ten or fifteen miles, and by three o’clock
sat down to a sumptuous dinner. Here we stayed
all night and the next morning recrossed the river,
finally striking the main Gadsden road and finding
our stampeded forces gathering at some gap, the
name of which I have forgotten. Here we met
General Wheeler, with the balance of his command.
We then moved down to the town of Gadsden,
where we recrossed the river and spent several
days resting our horses and ourselves.</p>

<p>General Hood, in the meantime, with his army,
crossed the Tennessee River, and General Sherman
returned to Atlanta, leaving Thomas’ Corps to follow
Hood into Middle Tennessee. Wheeler and
his cavalry returned to below Atlanta, where we
struck Sherman’s forces moving in the direction of
Macon, Georgia, by way of Augusta to Savannah.
We then had daily engagements with Kilpatrick’s
cavalry, often driving them into their infantry.
Sherman used his cavalry to forage for the army,
depending altogether on the country for his commissary.
To enter into detail of the many engagements
had on this trip would occupy too much time
and space. Our service was largely, as stated, to
keep his cavalry from foraging, burning and destroying
the country. In connection with this I
would mention an incident at Macon:</p>

<p>I was at a blacksmith’s shop with a comrade by
the name of Freeman, who was about seven years
my senior in age. While waiting to get our horses
shod we heard artillery, supported by small arms,
open at our works, about a mile across the river.
We immediately mounted our horses and dashed
over there and just as we got in sight of the roadway
through the breastworks we witnessed a lone
trooper of Kilpatrick’s cavalry coming up the road
through the works, having his horse shot just as
he reached inside. His horse fell on his leg, from
which position he was trying to extricate himself
and was about to be shot by an excited militia of
young and old men, who had never been under
fire before, when Jim put spurs to his horse and
with his pistol raised, dashed up to where this man
lay under his horse, and drove off the excited
militia, I, of course, following him. He called up a
lieutenant, asked his name, company and regiment;
told him to take charge of that prisoner and see
that he was well treated, that he would hold him
personally responsible for his safety, and immediately
wheeled his horse, I following him, and returned
to town without giving the lieutenant a
chance to ask questions. On our return I asked Jim
Freeman his reasons for doing as he did, risking his
own life, by being shot by the excited militia, in
order to save this Federal. He answered, “He is a
brother Mason.” I asked him if he ever met him
before. He said, “No, but I saw him give the grand
hailing sign of distress, which obligates a Mason
to save the life of a brother, at the risk of his own.”
Here was a beautiful illustration of the work of
Masonry, and I told Jim Freeman the first opportunity
I had of joining the Masons, if I lived through
the war, I intended to be one, which resolution I carried
out, joining the Masons at Rusk, Texas.</p>

<p>General Kilpatrick with about four thousand
picked cavalry, armed with Spencer repeating rifles,
which they were expert in handling, was detailed
by General Sherman, after leaving Jonesboro, to
forage and destroy property, under pretext of burning
gin houses. They also burned a great many
fine houses, the homes of rich people, on their line
of march, and got their operations down to a system.
He would have his engineers select a strong position
along the line of march, fortify it with rails and
logs and place about one thousand men in such
works. His engineers then would advance some two
or three miles and direct another line of fortifications
in a similar manner; the balance of his command
would scatter out on both flanks inside of
these lines, collect provisions and forage, burn gin
houses and homes, the latter of which, of course,
were plundered before being consigned to the flames.
In this manner he continued his operations to very
near the coast.</p>

<br/>
<span class='sc'>Georgia Service—A Negro’s Preference—A Hazardous Undertaking.</span></h2></div>

<p>At this time General Wheeler would detail a
fresh brigade every morning to take the advance
and move on the enemy.</p>

<p>When a few miles from Buck Head Creek, Harrison’s
Brigade was placed in advance. Striking the
first line of works, we formed a line and prepared
to charge, when General Felix Robertson was seen
immediately to the right of our line on a magnificent
horse. At the time, he was acting as chief of staff
to General Wheeler, and he gave the order to forward,
waving his hat and led the charge. We drove
them out of their works and it became a running
fight down the road with General Robertson leading,
having a better horse than the balance of us. We
soon struck a branch where the enemy had lined up
on the other side, and they poured a galling fire
into our advance. General Robertson had his arm
badly shattered by a bullet and being alone drew
his horse to one side at the ford of this branch.
When I saw him he appeared deathly pale, reeling
in his saddle, and a couple of the men behind me
started over to assist him, but he called to them,
“Never mind me, boys; crowd ’em, crowd ’em,”
which we did, and again started them on the run.
They made another stand across Buck Head Creek
near the church and set fire to the bridge, covering
the fire with a piece of artillery. Wheeler then sent
down a few men with long-range guns, dismounted,
who soon drove the artillery away. We then repaired
the bridge floor with benches out of the
church and were soon across the creek, after them,
with the Third Arkansas in advance.</p>

<p>As we were riding rapidly in pursuit, General
Wheeler passing our column to reach the advance
called to us, saying, “We’ve got them this time;
Dibrell is in the rear.” General Dibrell commanded
Tennessee cavalry. We soon got into an old sedge
field, an open country for several miles, where
Kilpatrick had established a fortified camp, built
a line of breastworks perhaps two miles wide, his
left flank touching the road.</p>

<p>The Third Arkansas had formed a line of battle
and was charging the breastworks perhaps two
hundred yards ahead of our regiment, which
emerged from the woods in columns of fours, moving
rapidly to the support of the Third Arkansas.
The enemy had planted four pieces of artillery in
the road on our right, which poured a galling fire
into the Third Arkansas, as well as our flank. The
Third Arkansas finally reached the breastworks
under a galling fire of four thousand Spencer
rifles and drove the gunners away from their artillery,
thereby silencing the same, but they were
unable to cross the works and not being supported
promptly, had to withdraw. The reason of our
failure to support promptly was that when we
reached about half way across the open, an order
came to us through Adjutant Billy Sayers for the
Rangers to file to the right into the road. This
divided our regiment, a part continuing ahead, the
other part moving into the road and, as soon as we
struck the road, a hail of grape and cannister
swept it and drove us into the thick woods across
the road and finally forced us to give up the attack,
which was most unfortunate, as the Third Arkansas
lost a good many men. Our regiment lost a few,
too, and nothing was accomplished. General Dibrell
was seen in our left front in the woods, unable
to strike Kilpatrick in the rear on account of not
being able to cross the creek. General Wheeler
now brought up his entire force, making disposition
of them for a final charge on Kilpatrick’s
flank and rear, as well as in front, and when we
moved forward we found the bird had flown; Kilpatrick
had abandoned his works and fled.</p>

<p>We next had quite a severe engagement with
the enemy’s cavalry near Griswoldville, said to
have been one of the most beautiful towns in Georgia,
which the enemy had burned. As soon as we
caught up with them we charged and drove them
into their infantry, which proved in heavy force
and forced us to retire.</p>

<p>At Waynesboro, Georgia, we had considerable
fighting in order to save Augusta, Georgia, which
had one of the largest arsenals in the Confederacy
and no doubt was a tempting prize for General
Sherman’s torch.</p>

<p>General Braxton Bragg happened to be in Augusta,
when he conceived the idea of resorting to
a ruse, which proved quite successful. He called
up General Wheeler by telegraph at Waynesboro
and instructed him when he was forced to give up
the town, to leave the telegraph office intact, but
give it the appearance of having been abandoned
precipitately, then advise him promptly when the
enemy entered town. Waiting a reasonable time
for the enemy to take charge of the telegraph office,
General Bragg called General Wheeler, when a Federal
officer answered. General Bragg said, “General
Wheeler, hold Waynesboro at all hazards. Longstreet’s
corps is arriving. I will take the field in
person tomorrow. Signed, Braxton Bragg.” This
had the desired effect. General Sherman, satisfied
he would have to give battle before Augusta was
surrendered, decided he had better pass by and move
on to Savannah as fast as possible. There is no
question but this ruse saved Augusta, Georgia,
though General Wheeler with his corps put up a
strong defense, never permitting the enemy to cross
Brier Creek, which was between them and Augusta.</p>

<p>About ten or twelve years after the war, when
General Sherman was a resident of St. Louis, he
gave an interview on the reason he spared Augusta,
Georgia. This had been a subject of discussion by
historians and especially friends of the North and
was frequently attributed to General Sherman having
relatives living in Augusta, Georgia. Another
story was that Mrs. Lincoln, through a relative or
friend, had stored in Augusta a large amount of cotton.
There were various other stories, which General
Sherman finally set at rest, giving his reasons
for sparing the city. He claimed that one of his
officers intercepted a telegram from General Bragg
to General Wheeler at Waynesboro, instructing him
to hold Waynesboro at all hazards, that Longstreet’s
corps was arriving and he would take personal command
the next day. He further stated that on account
of his depleted commissary, having to depend
on the country for the rations of his army, he was
in no condition to give battle, satisfied that Bragg
would defend Augusta to the last, therefore passed
it by and hastened to the coast. “But if the people
of Augusta think that I spared their city through
any love or affection for them, if the President
will give me permission, I will take a hundred thousand
of my bummers and go down and burn it
now.” I read this interview in a St. Louis paper.</p>

<p>When near Savannah, Georgia, the place having
been evacuated by our forces, who crossed the river
at Pocatalego, Wheeler’s cavalry was ordered to
cross the Savannah River at a point about fifteen
miles above Savannah. For this purpose we had
only one steamboat, and Harrison’s Brigade was ordered
to cross last, necessitating our camping in
the river bottom for several days, during which
time details were sent out of our brigade to collect
provisions, as we were without commissary. I had
charge the second day of a small detail, and after
riding about twenty miles, we scattered out, each
man to bring in as much as possible. On my return
to camp that evening late, without having succeeded
in securing anything, only a piece of cornbread
and a slice of bacon for myself, I was feeling
disgusted. When about a mile from our camp, following
a well-beaten path, I spied a negro man on
another path crossing the one I was on and when
within a few yards of me, I stopped him and asked
if he couldn’t tell me where there was something
to eat, telling him that I had ridden all day long,
trying to get something for our command and had
signally failed.</p>

<p>The country through which we had passed for
several days is the greatest sweet potato country perhaps
in the South; large fields all over the country
had been devoted to sweet potatoes, which had fallen
a ready prey to Sherman’s army and the whole country
seemed to be eaten out. I told this negro, after
he told me where he lived, about a half mile from
there, that I was satisfied he knew where there were
sweet potatoes and where there was corn for our
horses. He assured me he did not and said that the
Federals had taken everything that his old master
had and didn’t leave him a thing. I continued to
talk with him, trying to arouse his sympathy, told
him of our poor fellows not having had anything
to eat for several days and I had been riding all
day long without securing anything, thereby working
on his sympathy. Finally he broke down and
said, “Young Marster, if I were to tell you where
there are sweet potatoes, old marster would kill me.”
I told him that his old master never would know
anything about it, and he finally said he didn’t
think it was right, that his old master had given
these Yankees everything they wanted, had plenty of
potatoes left and refused to give our own folks
anything at all. “Now,” he said, “if you will
strike across this way,” pointing in the direction
of his house, entering a lane leading to the house,
“about a hundred and fifty yards this side of the
house, on the left across the fence, you will
find some haystack poles standing, with a lot of
shattered hay in the lot and if you will dig down
about two feet you will strike more potatoes than
you will need for several days. Up the river, in
the bottom, about two miles, you will find a couple
of pens of corn, enough to feed your horses for several
days.” He had just finished telling me, when
I noticed an old man, who proved to be his master,
coming our way, and as soon as the negro saw him
he said, “Fo’ Gawd, marster; there he is now; he’ll
kill me; he’ll kill me.” “No,” I said “he will not;
he never will know that you told me; you stand
perfectly still and don’t get scared.” I jerked out
my pistol and threw it down on him, telling him
within hearing of his old master, that if he didn’t
tell me where there was something to eat, I would
kill him, and the old man called, “Let that man
alone; he don’t know where there is anything to
eat; there is nothing on the place, the Federals just
took everything I had.” I still insisted on killing
the negro if he didn’t tell me where there was something
to eat, and finally let him off, satisfying the
old man that he hadn’t told me anything.</p>

<p>As soon as I reached camp I told Colonel Harrison
to get out a detail of fifty men, with sacks
to carry potatoes in, when he ordered Major Pearrie,
our commissary, to get out the detail and follow my
instructions. I told Pearrie that I was satisfied the
people at the house about a half mile from there
had plenty of potatoes, but did not tell him the
source of my information, determined not to tell
anybody. When we moved up the lane near the
house. Major Pearrie halted us, went to the house to
talk to the old man and negotiate for the potatoes,
when the old man satisfied him there were no potatoes
on the place. In the meantime I had no trouble
in finding the lot just as the negro had described
to me and when the major returned and ordered us,
“About face; move back to camp; there is nothing
to be had,” I dismounted, crossed the fence into
the lot and commenced digging with my hands and
in about two feet, struck potatoes, then called to the
men to come over with their sacks, which, it is hardly
necessary to say, we filled up to the top. We thought
we left potatoes enough to last the old man and
his family for another year, and perhaps more.
We then sent up the river bottom and found the
corn, on which we fed our horses. Here is another
instance of the attachment of the negro to our own
people, his sympathy for us controlling his actions,
and I always regretted not taking this negro along
with us, fearing perhaps that his old master might
have suspected him of giving us information about
these potatoes and corn.</p>

<p>After crossing the river and reaching Pocatalego,
we found General Hardee and General McLaws,
with the infantry out of Savannah and also
artillery organizations, which were turned into infantry.
General McLaws made a request on General
Wheeler for a company of cavalry, preferring
a company of Texas Rangers, to scout and act as
escort for him, when Company B, to which I belonged,
was detailed for this purpose.</p>

<p>One night, Captain King, inspector general on
McLaws’ staff, came down to our campfire and
requested me to accompany him on a ride across the
swamp, to find Wheeler’s cavalry, which I consented
to do. We proceeded into the swamp on a
corduroy road, the night being one of the darkest
we had ever been out in, the only light onto the road
was the sky appearing between the tall trees on
both sides, which governed us in keeping about the
middle of the road and kept us from riding off the
logs into the deep mud and water. After riding
perhaps a half mile, expecting every minute to be
fired on by Sherman’s advance pickets, our horses
necessarily making a great deal of noise by stumbling
over the logs, Captain King stopped and
asked did I not think one of us could get through
easier than both, as it would reduce the noise considerably.
I told him that it certainly would. He
then asked me if I would carry a written order to
General Wheeler, which was for Wheeler’s cavalry
not to fail to cross the swamp that night in order to
be on hand by daylight in the morning, when General
Hardee expected an attack by the enemy’s infantry.
I told Captain King that I would carry the order,
which he asked me to show every brigade commander
that I might find, until I reached General Wheeler.
Captain King then returned to General McLaws’
camp, as he would be needed the next
morning.</p>

<p>I rode through the swamp, crossed the bridge
and after about a twenty-mile ride, found Wheeler’s
cavalry, first striking a Georgia brigade, to a
colonel of which I read the order, when he immediately
ordered his brigade to saddle up; the next
I struck Harrison’s brigade, who also followed suit;
the next I struck Colonel Ashby’s headquarters,
commanding Tennesseans. I found him lying on
a pallet in front of a fireplace, surrounded by his
staff, all asleep. I showed him the order; after
reading it and noticing that I was wet, having ridden
in the rain part of the time, he made me step up
to the fire, then after drying my clothes, take his
pallet and sleep until it was time to cross the swamp,
his command being very near the swamp. He promised
me that he would send the dispatch direct to
General Wheeler, who was not far off and would
have me awakened when the last were about to cross,
thereby giving me as much sleep as possible. This
kind treatment of Colonel Ashby’s was much appreciated,
but was not a surprise to me, having known
him as one of the most gallant officers and gentlemen
I ever got acquainted with.</p>

<p>Some time after the war, meeting Lieutenant
Fulkerson, the commander of our company, at
Bryan, Texas, he told me that General McLaws
told him a few days after this engagement that
Graber’s ride that night, finding Wheeler’s cavalry,
who crossed the swamp in time to cover the retreat
of our infantry, no doubt saved our little army, only
about seven or eight thousand strong. This army
was composed of the infantry and artillery that
were stationed at Savannah and Charleston and
at different points along our line of retreat and was
joined at Bentonville with the remnant of Hood’s
army, out of Tennessee, after the disastrous Hood
campaign in that State.</p>

<p>While this humble individual service was nothing
extraordinary, nothing more than performed by
individual members of our company frequently, yet
the result was such that I always had cause to feel
proud of it. I forgot to mention that I crossed the
swamp without being fired on by the enemy, as
they had not reached that part of the crossing
when I passed through.</p>

<p>The following letter from General McLaws was
received by me more than thirty years after the
incident just related, as the date indicates:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>Savannah, Ga., April 9th, 1897.</p>

<p class='noindent'>My Dear Graber:</p>

<p>Your letter of the 5th reached me yesterday
evening, and it gave me great pleasure to receive it,
for I have very often spoken of the Texas company
which formed my escort for a great deal of the time
during that campaign, and always in praise of its
daring spirit and its devotion to our cause. And
there is no one in the company whose name I have
mentioned more often than yours, for I saw more
of you personally than of most of them, as you were
sometimes connected with my scouting party.</p>

<p>When the Federal Army, which crossed at Fort
Royal ferry, commenced its movement northward
to meet the column under General Sherman, which
came from Savannah, it was your company scouts
which gave me notice of it, and I commenced following
their movement along one side, which was
the left bank of the Salkatchie. The night I left
my headquarters was a very cold one, and the troops
suffered considerably. I had an A. D. C., a relative
of mine, whom I had found in Colcock’s regiment
of cavalry, and, not being accustomed to campaigning,
he grumbled some as we rode along and my
other A. D. C., Mr. Lamar, hearing him, asked what
was the matter. He replied, “Lamar, if this is
liberty, I would rather be a slave.” We arrived in
time to successfully defeat the crossing at Braxton’s
Bridge, and I then rode on that night to Reeves’
Bridge, some eight or ten miles above, and, finding
everything in readiness, rode on to the bridge above.
When I started from Braxton’s Bridge, I had some
seven or eight of Colcock’s cavalry, who professed
to know the country, and I had sent several of them
to find Wheeler’s cavalry, in order to get a force
from him to help defend the crossing at Reeves’
Bridge the next day, but I heard afterwards it was
not done and in some unaccountable way my escort
from Colcock’s cavalry disappeared, every one of
them. Fortunately I came across my inspecting officer,
Captain King, a very energetic and fearless
soldier, and I directed him to go on and bring over
a division of cavalry under Wheeler, have them
dismounted and placed in line close to the swamps
on the right of the infantry force at Reeves’ Bridge.
I went on to the bridge above where General Hardee
was in command, and he, seeming confident
of holding his position, I started back to
Reeves’ Bridge alone, my escort having disappeared,
as I have stated. On my way back, I came across
a camp of a single teamster with his team and
wagon. I dismounted, told him who I was, and
asked him to feed my horse and let me lie down
by his fire and to wake me before daylight, all of
which he consented to. Before daylight the next
day, I was on my way and arrived at Reeves’ Bridge
very early and found that Wheeler had sent me a
division of cavalry which was placed as I had directed.
I met Captain King, who told me of the
daring ride of you and himself, and of your desperate
venture to find the cavalry, and for which
I was very grateful, for, had it not been for additional
force thus acquired, the enemy would have
crossed above me early in the day, for the Salkhatchie
had fallen so much that it had become fordable
and the enemy were crossing not only above,
but parties crossed between Reeves’ and Braxton’s
bridges, and after crossing in sufficient numbers to
warrant it they would have come down on my flank
at Reeves’ bridge, and I would have had to retire.
The presence of the cavalry prevented this. The
cavalry late in the day, having exhausted its ammunition,
I directed that they be formed mounted
in the woods in the rear, and to charge any body
of the enemy attempting to make a flank attack of
the force at the bridge. This condition continued
until sundown, when I directed the officer in command
at the bridge to increase his force in the
fortifications protecting the bridge and then to
withdraw his artillery by hand, and as night approached
the troops were withdrawn and I directed
them to march directly to the rear and bivouac
after going four or five miles. I then rode towards
Braxton’s bridge alone, my Carolina cavalry escort
never returning to me. As I rode along I saw a
mounted man sitting on his horse looking intently
down the road. As I approached he heard my coming
and turning recognized me and spoke quickly,
telling me that the enemy had crossed and were
between us and Braxton’s bridge. I told him to go
ahead and act as scout and keep a good lookout.
So on we went until we saw a man on horseback.
His horse was half hidden in a blacksmith’s shop.
He also was looking down the road intently, and,
as I came up, he also said the enemy had crossed,
and were occupying the road. I told him to join
the other man and go ahead. We had not gone far
when I heard the rapid gallop of a number of
horses, and I thought to myself if the enemy have
crossed cavalry I may be captured, so I withdrew
a little off the road, so as to have a chance of running
quickly to my infantry in the rear. A considerable
body appeared, dashing wildly on, each
man having his pistol drawn, and, as they came near,
I was saluted with wild hurrahs. It was the lieutenant
with his Texas company, who told me that
he had heard I had been captured, and he had
determined to rescue me at the risk of the lives of
all, and the men demanded it. Of course, I was much
gratified, and, feeling myself secure, we rode on
rapidly to find out what had been done at Braxton’s
bridge. As we went, the first of the parties who
had crossed the river were visible but a short distance
away, three or four hundred yards along the
edge of the river swamp to which they had retired.
We halted where the Braxton bridge road joined
the one I was on, and I sent in my staff officer,
Captain King, to tell the officer to march his command
in my direction. After waiting a long time,
word came that he had started his command on another
road. He had become alarmed, because parties
of the enemy had been seen by his command
to cross the river above him, and he was apprehensive
of being intercepted. I let him go, although
his scare cost his men a good many more miles of
marching. My escort, with myself in charge, rode
on towards the Ediste, bringing up the rear. I
would very much like to read your account of what
took place when you were with Paysinger. He
would come in after a scout between twelve and
daylight at night, and would report to me at once,
and he gave valuable information as to the movements
of the enemy.</p>

<p>The morning after the Battle of Bentonville he
came to my tent about three o’clock a. m., and told
me that the enemy were moving on our left. I so reported
to General Hardee, but he had been notified
by General Hampton that the enemy were marching
on my right, and I was sent with my command on
the right. I then told General Hardee that I was
apprehensive that there was a mistake, that I was
so certain that our left would be attacked and not
the right, I would not fortify it, but wait for the
order to return to the left. We had not been on
the right an hour before General Hardee came himself
in great haste, calling for my command to
hurry to the left, and we did get back just in
time to check the enemy. Of the things done in
these days there are many that I would like very
much to have related again by those who were participants,
but it would hardly do to put them in
print. The conduct of the enemy was, however, so
exasperating that there was no treatment too harsh
as a punishment for their misdeeds, and I have always
regretted that there had not been more scouting
parties organized to follow in the wake of Sherman’s
army and circulate on his flank. Your company
acting as scouts, as well as escort, working
in small parties, encouraging individual daring and
enterprise, was equally as efficient as a much larger
body moving in compact mass under one head.</p>

<p>I shall always remember with pleasure the duties
you performed while acting as my escort and also
the pleasure I had in my personal intercourse with
you, as individuals. I always kept in my mind that
the individual soldier was entitled to be treated with
the respect due to a gentleman, if his behavior warranted
it. This in our Southern army. You will
oblige me by assuring all of Company B of my high
regard and respect for them individually as brave
and honorable men, and collectively as an organized
company, for I gave them a chance to show their
characters in both ways, and was sorry to part with
you all.</p>

<p>Very truly your obedient servant,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>L. McLAWS.</p>

</div>

<p>We served with General McLaws until after the
Battle of Bentonville and to the time of surrender
of Johnston’s army at Jonesboro, North Carolina,
never uniting with the regiment again, though occasionally
meeting with them, notably at the Battle
of Bentonville, where they distinguished themselves
by one of the most brilliant charges ever made by
cavalry. This charge was made without our company
(as we were with General McLaws and the
infantry) and resulted in the safety of the whole
army by saving an only bridge across a deep river,
the only means of retreat of the army. It seems
this bridge was guarded by some of Hampton’s
cavalry, when General Sherman ordered Mower’s
corps to make a dash around our left flank and capture
this bridge and destroy it. While Mower was
proceeding to do this by a rapid advance in the
rear of our army, he had his pioneer corps with
their spades and picks ready to entrench, and when
in sight of the bridge, he poured a volley on the
South Carolina cavalry, who immediately abandoned
it. General Hardee dashed up to where our
regiment was formed, at the time perhaps not numbering
two hundred men, and asked, “Who commands
this regiment?” A Lieutenant Matthews
spoke and said he was in command of the regiment
this morning. The general asked, “Lieutenant, can
you hold those people in check until I can bring
up the infantry and artillery?” He answered,
“General, we are the boys that can try,” and called
to the Rangers to “Come on.”</p>

<p>Right here I would mention a sad incident in
connection with this charge. General Hardee had
an only son, a boy about eighteen years old, who
importuned him for a month or more, to allow him
to join the Texas Rangers, and he had only given his
consent that morning for the boy to join the regiment
and he had fallen into rank with Company D.
Another case: Eugene Munger, a cousin of our Dallas
Mungers, who had borne a charmed life from
the time he joined the Rangers after the Battle of
Shiloh, and had never had a scratch, happened to
be on a visit to the regiment, talking with some
friends, when this charge was ordered. As they
went in, passing by General Hardee, his son saluted
him. The Rangers went into a thick woods, hardly
suited for a cavalry charge, raising their accustomed
yell and with their pistols, dashed into the first line
of infantry, who on account of the sudden, unexpected
onslaught, must have overshot them in their
first volley. The Rangers were right among them,
drove them into the second line, which became demoralized
and fell back in confusion, the Rangers
immediately withdrawing with quite a number of
prisoners, bringing out their dead and wounded.
Among the dead were Hardee’s son and Eugene
Munger. But they accomplished what was intended.
General Hardee had brought up his infantry and
artillery, which held the enemy in check until night,
when the army crossed the bridge and was saved.</p>

<p>About an hour before the Rangers’ desperate
charge, General McLaws sent for me, when I found
him immediately in the rear of his breastworks. He
instructed me to take two or three men of the company
and move around in the rear of Sherman’s
army and ascertain if Schofield’s army, who had
headquarters at Goldsboro, was moving to the support
of Sherman, telling me that our army would
fall back that night on the road to Raleigh and I
would find him somewhere on that road. Taking
three other members of the company, among whom
was Virge Phelps, an old Mexican and Indian
fighter, a man of extraordinary nerve, we proceeded
across the bridge, then up Mill Creek towards Little
River, where we found a division of the enemy
camped about fifteen miles towards Goldsboro. We
then proceeded on towards Goldsboro and found
everything quiet outside of the enemy’s camps. We
ran in vidette pickets on several roads leading into
Goldsboro, when finally we reached the town of
Pikeville, the first station on the Goldsboro and Weldon
Railroad. Here we stopped to make some inquiries,
wearing our Federal overcoats and drawing
up at a house for this purpose we asked for a drink
of water. A very good looking, intelligent lady
came out with a bucket and dipper and handed us
water. On inquiry we found the enemy had never
entered the town and none had been seen there.
Finally this good lady asked us what command we
belonged to. We told her that we belonged to the
Fourth New York Cavalry, which claim we had
made at several places where we had stopped for
information. This woman kept looking at us and
finally said, “Young man, you can’t fool me; you
are no Yankees, you are some of our own folks.”
I asked her why she thought so. “Well,” she said,
“I imagine Yankees don’t talk like you do,” which
caused us to laugh, and as we then had decided to
return and make report to General McLaws, I
thought it wouldn’t make any difference to tell
her who we were and stated that we belonged to
Wheeler’s cavalry. This brought forth a tirade
of abuse from this woman. I said Wheeler’s cavalry
purposely to ascertain if the terrible name of
Wheeler’s cavalry had reached there. Wheeler’s
cavalry, through misrepresentations and frequently
through the acts of Yankee scouting parties claiming
to belong to Wheeler’s cavalry, had gained a
very unenviable reputation, so when we claimed to
belong to Wheeler’s cavalry, this woman said, “I
wish I was a man; I would shoulder a gun and help
put you down and only wish the Yankees would
come in here right now and kill the last one of you.”
I said, “Madam, you needn’t wish for the Yankees,
you will have them soon enough and get a taste
of some of their deviltry.” We then proceeded back
in the direction of the Raleigh road from
Bentonville.</p>

<br/>
<span class='sc'>I Sell a Ten Dollar Gold Piece for Fifteen Hundred Dollars.</span></h2></div>

<p>I will recite an incident occurring while we were
camped about six miles on a plank road from Fayetteville,
North Carolina, which place was also a
manufacturing point for war munitions on a small
scale, also had a large cotton factory: The enemy
were moving on two roads, converging into Fayetteville,
one road opposed by Rhett’s Brigade of
South Carolinians (General Rhett having been captured
a few days before). General McLaws sent
for me about daylight and instructed me to take one
or two members of the company and ride across
the country to the road occupied by Rhett’s Brigade,
stating that Rhett’s pickets had been run in
the night before, then after watching the road for
some time, if I found no enemy passing, to ride up
the road until we met or heard of them. We rode
up the road to the eleventh milepost, when we discovered
some women up in a field near a house,
watching the road and decided to go and interrogate
them on whether they had seen any enemy passing.
I told Jim Freeman, one of the party, to stay in the
road and carefully watch the direction from whence
we were expecting the enemy and Joe Hungerford
and I would go up and talk with these women, suggesting
to Jim if the enemy came in sight and he had
time to come to us, to do so, but if he had not, to
fire his pistol and run in toward town or go back
the way we had come and report to General McLaws
and on his firing his pistol we would make our way
across from where we were. After reaching the
women they told us they had been watching for an
hour or more and had seen no passing, but had
heard, the night before, that the enemy were advancing
on that road. After getting this information
they insisted on our waiting a little while,
that they were cooking breakfast and wanted us to
share it with them, which we decided to do, remaining
on our horses. Very soon Jim Freeman
came up to us and reported that he saw a Yankee
vidette picket about a half a mile ahead of where
he stood. We concluded, as we had time, that we
would finish our breakfast and go down and run
him in, which we proceeded to do. When reaching
the place in the road where Jim saw this Yankee,
he could not be found. I then suggested that he
was not a picket, but had strayed away from his
command for some purpose and would no doubt be
found at some house. We soon discovered a house
a few hundred yards ahead, but a little swamp between
us and the house prevented us from going
directly to it and after proceeding a couple of hundred
yards down the road, we found a dirt road
coming into the plank road, but at the mouth of this
road, owing to a turn in it, we were unable to see
the house. I then suggested to the boys that they
wait there and I would go up to the house and see
if this Yankee was there.</p>

<p>After proceeding some little distance, the road
turned and brought me in full view of the house,
with this Yankee at the gate, his gun on his shoulder,
just starting in. Having on my Yankee overcoat,
I slipped my pistol out of its holster, intending
to ride up and make him lay down his gun, when
he discovered me and smiled, mistaking me for one
of their own men. Just as I got ready to throw
my pistol down on him the boys on the plank road
started in a fast lope down the way we had come,
which was notice to me that the enemy were on to
them. I had but little time to decide. I knew if
I shot this Yankee it would attract those on the
plank road and if I wheeled to run away from him
he would perhaps shoot me, but I decided to take
my chance on the latter and broke for the plank
road. Just as I entered the plank road I noticed
a column of infantry within about one hundred and
fifty yards. I wheeled to the right very suddenly,
which threw the cape of my overcoat over my head,
put spurs to my horse, made him do his best, expecting
every moment to be shot off the horse, but
they never fired a shot, simply calling, “Halt,
halt!” The blue overcoat no doubt saved my life,
as they evidently thought I was one of their own
men. When the boys heard me coming, they stopped
and after we got together we struck across the
country the way we had come and reported to General
McLaws, which soon started our little army
on a hasty march into Fayetteville, where we
found Rhett’s Brigade, who had moved in during
the night, and had sent notice by a courier, which
notice never reached General Hardee. Our army
then passed through Fayetteville very rapidly,
whatever stores there were in the place, of any
value to our army, had been removed, and the bridge
across the river was all ready to be burned in an
instant.</p>

<p>After the army had safely passed over, as also
our cavalry, I stopped at a store near the market-house
to try to sell a ten dollar gold piece, belonging
to one of my comrades, for Confederate money.
This was perhaps the last gold piece we had in the
command and the last of two hundred dollars in
gold my comrade had sent to him from Texas. I
found in this store a few yards of butternut jeans
and forty or fifty pairs of knit socks, all the goods
the fellow had and with his little safe half full of
stacks of Confederate money. I asked him a hundred
and fifty for one for the gold piece, when he
offered me seventy-five for one and while dickering
on this trade, we heard the guns fire up the street,
when he counted me out fifteen hundred dollars,
very quickly for my gold piece. I just had time to
spring on to my horse and cross the bridge, which
very soon after, was burned, with the enemy moving
into Fayetteville.</p>

<p>The army then moved down the river to Averysboro,
where they built an earth breastworks from a
swamp, through which had passed a hurricane
down to the Cape Fear River and in front of this,
another, perhaps a half mile from the main works—a
short line of works, which was occupied by
Rhett’s Brigade, with a battery of artillery. While
our company with General McLaws and staff, were
awaiting developments near where the roadway ran
through the earthworks, General Hardee dashed
up and called to General McLaws to send two of
your Texas people down the line on our left and
ascertain if the enemy are flanking in force, when
I, in company with Lieutenant Bennett, dashed
down the line until we struck the swamp, then
turned into the swamp among fallen trees and brush
until we became separated, when I was finally fired
on by the enemy’s skirmish line, which forced me
to run back through this fallen timber. But having
a clear-footed horse, I succeeded in getting
through to the end of the woods, and there started
to run back, away from the fire of the infantry,
when a Colonel Fizer commanding the brigade immediately
behind the works, called me back and
gave me a message to General Hardee, which I was
forced to carry up the line, exposed to the fire of
the main line of the enemy, which struck our works
obliquely. I delivered my message to General Hardee
just as Rhett’s Brigade was moving inside of the
works from their advanced position, protected by
the gallant defense of a regiment of Georgians he
had thrown forward outside of the main works.
When the main line of the enemy poured a hot fire
onto that part of the works where we were halted,
we dashed into the woods somewhat out of range.
Here a ball struck Captain Lamar’s fine mare on
the back and she commenced laming. Lamar
thought that she would fall with him and begged
me to take him up behind me, which I refused to
do, unless his mare actually fell. He still insisted
on my taking him behind, when I proposed to swap,
to which he readily assented, but the mare never
gave out and I brought her into camp safely that
night.</p>

<p>This animal, one of the finest in the army, was
a present to Captain Lamar from a friend of his in
Savannah and was said to have cost a thousand dollars
in gold. After eating our supper that night
General McLaws sent for me to come up to his
camp fire, when he asked me to exchange back
with Lamar, saying that Lamar prized the mare
very highly, as she was a present to him. I told
him most certainly I would do so, that I did not
expect to keep her, but tender her back to him,
which, of course, was very gratifying to all
concerned.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXI<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>My Service With Captain Shannon.</span></h2></div>

<p>It was our custom, when on these scouts inside
of the enemy’s lines, to rest for a part of the night
out of sight and hearing of the road, turning in
when away from any settlement or house, so we
would not be seen and spend the balance of the
night in sleep in perfect safety, without having a
guard. After spending that night in the woods,
we returned to the road and found a large number
of fresh horse tracks leading towards Little River.
We construed these to mean that a Federal scout
had passed during the night, which we decided to
catch up with; charge their rear and stampede them.
In about two or three miles from there our road
rose up on a little bluff against a fence, then turned
down the fence to the west into a lane, past a house.
In the corner of the field was a barn lot, with
several barns, where we found about thirty or forty
Federals saddling their horses. We immediately
withdrew unobserved, under the bluff, to consult,
and I suggested to the boys to go around this field,
in the woods, strike the road below, wait in ambush
until these fellows passed, then charge their rear,
as intended. Virge Phelps refused to listen and
insisted on charging them right there and then,
which I conceived to be a very foolish thing to
do, but finally had to yield. As we rose the bluff
the second time, we discovered one of Shannon’s
men coming over the fence, out of the field, which
we knew meant that Shannon was camped there
with a lot of prisoners.</p>

<p>Captain Shannon was instructed by General
Hood at Atlanta to select twenty-five or thirty men
out of the regiment and operate inside of Sherman’s
lines all the time, getting information, and punishing
marauders wherever found engaged in their nefarious
business of robbing and burning homes.</p>

<p>Shannon’s selection of the men he had with him
soon won for him and his scout a reputation with
our army, and especially with the enemy, second to
no scout ever sent out by any army. Mosby’s exploits
in Virginia have been considered most wonderful
achievements for any small body of men.
The operations of Shannon’s scouts have never been
written, but where they were known, surpassed
anything ever heard of.</p>

<p>Immediately after recognizing this man, coming
over from the field, we hunted up Captain Shannon
and reported to him our work of the day before,
when he stated he was going to send these prisoners
to headquarters and suggested that I make my report
to General McLaws by the lieutenant in charge
and that we go back with him, as he expected to go
over the same ground that we had passed over
the day before. This we were very willing and anxious
to do, having never been in any engagement
with him.</p>

<p>Shannon made it a rule that wherever he struck
the enemy he would charge them at once and when
he found they were too strong for him he would
run out and leave them, sometimes drawn up in line
of battle, shelling the woods after he was gone. As
soon as ready, Shannon moved out with our little
party in the rear, they having better horses than
ours, as they managed by some means, to keep in
fresh horses all the time.</p>

<p>One of the first places we stopped to inquire
proved to belong to a very intelligent old Rebel
lady, who reported that an officer and a private
and a negro soldier had just left her house, the
negro driving her buggy, carrying off a lot of fine
dress goods and silverware and valuables in the
buggy and the others having threatened to hang her
if she failed to tell where her money was, forcing
her to give up about a hundred dollars in gold
and several thousand dollars in Confederate bonds.
She told Captain Shannon, “If you will just hurry
up, you will catch up with them,” which we did,
in about two miles from there. The first one of the
party caught up with was the negro soldier driving
the horse and buggy, when a member of the advance
guard rode up by the side of him and shot
him out of the buggy. It seemed as though the ball
of his big pistol sent his body about five feet on
the roadside, which made the scout smile, looking
back at us.</p>

<p>At a house about a quarter of a mile ahead of us,
we found two horses hitched, which turned out to
belong to the lieutenant and the private, who had
taken the old lady’s money. Shannon called back,
“Don’t but two of you stop here.” A couple of
Shannon’s men threw their bridle reins over the
fence and rushed into the house, when immediately
afterwards we heard pistols rattle in that house.
We then continued on this road to where it enters
the main county road, running parallel with the
Goldsboro &amp; Weldon Railroad. Just before reaching
the main county road Captain Shannon halted
us, when he went forward, looked up and down the
road, came back, commanded, “Form fours and
charge!” I don’t think I ever saw men going into
a charge like Shannon’s men, all breaking ranks,
trying to get to the front, not knowing whether
they were charging a small body of thirty or fifty
men or a whole brigade until they got into the main
county road, which disclosed about sixty or seventy
mounted infantry with their guns swung on their
backs, at the mouth of the lane, drinking and talking.
The head of Shannon’s column entered the
body of the Yankees, shooting their way in among
them. All offered to surrender, throwing up their
hands with only one gun fired by them and that
by a man about to enter a swamp below the field,
firing back at us over his shoulder. These cowardly
devils were not soldiers, only in name, they were
a band of highwaymen and plunderers in the uniform
of the United States and the most of them
loaded down with plunder of every description.</p>

<p>We next proceeded on the main road towards
Pikesville, taking a batch of prisoners along with us,
guarded by only two or three of Shannon’s scouts.
We found these plunderers at every house on the
way to Pikesville, a distance of five or six miles, and
also in the town. Pikesville was a town of about
fifty or seventy-five inhabitants, a blacksmith
shop, store and postoffice, railroad station and a few
residences. On entering the town our party became
very much scattered, as we found Federals in
nearly every house. A party of about six or eight
on horseback tried to escape, when I, with two or
three of Shannon’s boys, started after them, capturing
the whole bunch.</p>

<p>Returning to town I noticed the house where
we stopped the day before and had such a tirade
of abuse from the woman, of which Shannon’s boys
with me, knew nothing. I suggested to them
to let us go by that house and get a drink of water.
The prisoners begged for water also. Riding up to
the house, the door opened and my good lady of
the day before put in her appearance, when I said
to her, “Now, run and get your friends some
drinking water; they are very thirsty.” “No,”
she said, “I wouldn’t give them a drink of water
to save their lives. Come in, sir, and see what they
did in my house.” I told her that I did not care
to see it, but to run and get some water for her
friends, when she again started to abuse the prisoners.
I told her she must stop that, they were our
prisoners and could not be abused by her.</p>

<p>After getting together the prisoners taken in
this town and leaving about a half dozen men to
guard them, somewhere near a hundred, we started
out on a short scout on the road we had run over
after the parties trying to make their escape. When
about a mile and a half from town in a straight
lane, having very high rail fences on both sides, we
met about eighty or a hundred more, evidently on
their way to town. The head of their column halted,
viewing one of their dead bodies lying in the road,
one of the men that was killed by our little party
running after them, trying to make their escape.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention when starting out on this
last scout that I told Shannon our party wanted
to move in the advance guard, as we had hardly
got a shot, his men always keeping ahead of us
and we did not want to go back to the regiment and
say we had been with Shannon’s scouts unable to do
any effective service. Captain Shannon replied,
“All right; go ahead and report to Bill Smith,”
who was a first lieutenant and always commanded
the advance guard. When within about two hundred
yards of this column, viewing the body, I asked
Smith, as he was moving us quite rapidly, “What
are you going to do; are you going to charge these
fellows?” He said, “Come on; come on.” I looked
back and saw Shannon coming up in a lope with
about fifteen or eighteen men, then noticed the Federal
column getting restless and probably four or
five of them break, when I said to Smith, “Now
is our time,” and we drove ahead, scattering the
whole business, capturing a number of prisoners,
besides a number left in the road.</p>

<p>We next collected all our prisoners in the town
and found that perhaps not more than seventy per
cent could speak the English language and we were
told that these foreigners had just been imported
from Europe, rushed through Castle Garden, right
to the army. They were told by the recruiting
agents in Europe that they would receive large
bounties, good pay and good treatment and be entitled
to everything they captured, which latter
of course, proved the greatest inducement of all.</p>

<p>We camped with Shannon that night near the
town, and parted with him the next morning, they
moving in the direction of Goldsboro, while we
started back to our army, which we never saw again
until the night of the day of the surrender, which
was several weeks after.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXII<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>We Receive Notice of Johnston’s Surrender—I Decline to be Paroled and Resolve to Make My Way Out.</span></h2></div>

<p>After leaving Bentonville our army continued its
retreat, the main part of the army finally moving
in the direction of Greensboro, where it surrendered.
Our little party continued to operate on Sherman’s
flank, when we heard that there was a large amount
of meat collected by the Federal cavalry at a
little place called Marlboro, and we decided to get
a wagonload of this meat and carry it with us to
our army. For this purpose we impressed a wagon
and team and loaded up with hams, which proved
a great encumbrance to us and about the third day
we left all with a poor widow woman, with her promise
to hide out the hams in the woods and try to
save them from capture. We finally reached our
regimental camp the night of the surrender of Johnston’s
army. Our regiment at first notice of the
surrender, decided to make their way out and not
take parole, but General Wheeler came down and
made them a talk, stating the terms of the surrender
to be that the cavalry would be permitted
to retain their horses and sidearms and go home
unmolested, if they could show a parole; but if not
they would be treated and shot as Guerillas. Under
this condition General Wheeler advised them to surrender,
which they decided to do.</p>

<p>After feeding my horse and eating a little supper,
I tried to make up a party to make our way
out without taking a parole, believing that the
army would be sent to prison, and, having determined
never to see the inside of another prison,
I prepared to go out and succeeded in inducing
about thirty of the regiment to go out with me.
We rode all night, and next morning came to a
place where we found Colonel Harrison on crutches,
standing in the door. I dismounted and went in to
tell him that the army had surrendered and when
about half way to him in the yard, he motioned to
me with his hand, saying, “Back to your command;
back to your command.” I told him that we were
on our way to Texas, the army had surrendered and
the Rangers had decided to surrender with the
army and take a parole, which brought tears to
his eyes. He repeated, “The army has surrendered
and the Rangers going to surrender with the army?
You did right, sir, in coming out; the Rangers shall
not surrender with the army; I am going to send
them word to come out.” He then bade us good-bye
and we proceeded on our way.</p>

<p>That night we got to the town of Lexington,
where we decided to stop for the night, camping at
the edge of the town. I went into town to have
some bread cooked for the party and it commenced
to rain. Finally I succeeded in finding a place
where a lady agreed to cook the bread for us all.
The gentleman insisted on my staying at his house
until his wife could cook the bread, which would
take her all night, and as a further inducement,
said if I would stay he would go with me the next
morning and show me where about thirty barrels of
Catawba wine was hid out, from which we could
fill our canteens. The next morning, going down
to where I had left the boys in camp, loaded down
with bread, I found they had gone and left me.
They had evidently become alarmed during the
night and, not knowing where I could be found,
they decided I would be able to make my way out
all right. I then struck out, taking as much of the
bread as I could conveniently carry, but did not
take time to get any of the wine. I took the main
Charlotte road, when in about two or three miles,
the road forked, one seemed about as much traveled
as the other. About six miles from there, towards
Charlotte, I came to a house where I found
Major Jarmon of our regiment, badly wounded,
with several of our men taking care of him. These
men told me that our party who had left me, had
divided at the forks of the road, part of them taking
the right hand, intending to go through Middle
Tennessee and East Tennessee, the others going on
to Charlotte, there to cross the river and go over
into South Carolina. I then decided to go back to
the forks of the road, take the right hand and try
to catch up with the party going to Tennessee.</p>

<p>After following this road about two or three
miles, I came to a branch, where I stopped to water
my horse and immediately discovered about eight
or ten old men and young boys riding horses, unshod,
and with citizens’ saddles. They had a few
squirrel rifles and no other weapons, and were also
watering their horses in the branch near me. They
asked me what command I belonged to. I told
them I belonged to the Texas Rangers and my company
was just ahead, when I asked them what command
they belonged to. They said they belonged
to General Lee’s cavalry, which I knew was not true,
but that they were bushwhackers and I decided to
get away from them as soon as possible. I started
across the branch and at a little turn of the road
I struck a trot, when two of them loped up behind
me, separating, one on each side of me, one of them
demanding to buy my saddle. I told him it was
not for sale. The other wanted to buy one of my
pistols. I told them they couldn’t have anything
I had; “I know what you are after and if you
know what is good for you, you had better drop
back and let me alone.” They stopped and, I
thought, started back to their party. I soon got
to another turn of the road out of their sight, and
struck a lope and ran about a mile and a half. I
concluded perhaps they would come no further.
I discovered a woman plowing in the field, at the
far end of which was a log house on the edge of
the woods, and just at the corner of the fence I
noticed some fresh horse tracks turned off the road,
which I concluded perhaps was our party who had
gone to the house to get something to eat. I waited
in the fence corner for the woman to return to the
end of the row and asked if she had seen any men
riding down the line of fence to the house, when
she claimed she did not and while talking with
her here this gang of bushwhackers came dashing
up and surrounded me in the fence corner. I pulled
out one of my pistols and told them the first man
that raised a gun I’d kill “and I’ll get a number of
you before you get me, for I am an expert shot and
never miss,” when one of them said, “Come on,
boys; let’s leave the d—— fool.” I told them,” Yes,
you’d better leave.” Unfortunately for me, they
turned right up the road, the way I wanted to go
and when they concluded I had quit watching them,
they turned into the woods, no doubt expecting me
to continue on the road and they would then ambush
me.</p>

<p>I first concluded that I must catch up with our
party, as I was exceedingly anxious to go with them
into Tennessee and it was not safe for me to go by
myself, therefore decided I would ride along leisurely
until I got up to the point where they turned
out of the road, then, with my pistol raised, I would
put spurs to my horse and run the gauntlet, which
on further reflection, I concluded that I had better
not attempt, as they would be bound to hit my
horse in running by. I therefore turned back the
way I had come. When within about two or three
miles of the main forks of the road, I struck a well-beaten
path, running in the direction of the Charlotte
road, which I decided to take and getting
back into the Charlotte road, I would ride on to
Charlotte. After riding in this path about a mile
and a half, I came to a large log house, to reach
the front gate of which I had to pass through a
barn lot that had a large gate, fastened by a log
chain wrapped around the bottom of the gate and
the gate post. When I got down off my horse to
unwind this chain, I heard some one speak and when
I looked up I found an old gentleman on the other
side of the lot with a shotgun leveled on me. I
told him not to shoot, “I am a friend and want some
directions.” He said, “Now, that animal isn’t fit
for you to ride and would be of no use to you, but
you can’t take her.” I told him, “My friend, I
don’t want your horse, I have as good a horse as
I want. I only want some directions,” and after
talking with him a little, satisfied him that I was
not after his horse, when he invited me in. I then
told him about being on my way home to Texas
and how I had been separated from the party I
was going with and wanted to get to the Charlotte
road the nearest way I could get there. He then
begged me to spend the balance of the day and stay
all night with him. After finding that he was a
good Southern man, I decided to do so, satisfied I
would never catch up with our party that had taken
the Charlotte road and I needed rest very badly, as
also my horse.</p>

<p>The old gentleman told me that that whole country
was overrun by a band of marauders that had
been pillaging and robbing their homes and they
had had a meeting of the people in the neighborhood
and decided whenever a house was attacked they
would blow a horn and all rush to the place of attack,
there to shoot down every man they found that
had no business there. It is hardly necessary to say
that he wished they would attack his house the
night I was there, because I had four pistols and
was regarded by him as pretty good reinforcement,
but nothing of the sort happened. I spent a very
restful and pleasant night, with a good supper and
breakfast, and next day started out, by a near
road, to strike the Charlotte pike, which I did some
several miles ahead of where I left Major Jarman,
the day before, badly wounded.</p>

<p>When I finally reached Charlotte, I stopped to
make some inquiry of an infantry guard stationed
at a big stable, who told me that the guards in
town had orders to arrest every man from Johnston’s
army without a parole and advised me to
pass around the main part of the town, into the
road I was going on to. He furthermore told me
that our whole Confederate Government was then in
Charlotte; President Davis, with General Breckenridge,
then Secretary of War; Judge Reagan, Postmaster
General, and all the rest, and they had just
heard the news of Lincoln’s assassination, which
seemed to have cast a gloom over the entire party.</p>

<p>I now proceeded on my way, around the town,
back into the main road leading out to Bady’s
Ferry and when within four or five miles of the
ferry, I met a citizen who had just crossed there
and reported that Colonel Clarence Prentice, with
about two hundred Kentuckians, had just crossed
there and had been captured by a heavy force of
Federal cavalry and by them paroled and permitted
to go on his way home. Then further conferring
with this citizen about where I could best cross the
Catawba River, he told me of a batteau at a mill
about twelve miles below Charlotte, when I decided
to ride down there and cross in this batteau, which
I did, putting my saddle and everything in the batteau,
paddling across and swimming my mare,
which landed me in a wheat field, in the State of
South Carolina.</p>

<p>After getting straightened out again for the road
I got directions to Anderson Courthouse, which I
reached in due time and found Colonel Harrison,
with a large party of Rangers, resting and having
a good time. Harrison, if the reader will remember,
was badly wounded and was just recovering, using
crutches, when a party of Rangers came along after
we had left, secured an ambulance and crossed the
Catawba River with two batteaux, one on each
side, thus bringing him out to Anderson Courthouse,
which was his old home and where he had relatives.</p>

<p>After resting another day we again struck out
for the Mississippi River, passing through South
Carolina, into Georgia, then into Alabama. Before
reaching the State of Alabama, we heard that the
Mississippi River was out of its banks and about
thirty miles wide, which forced us to scatter out and
lay up at different points, until the river ran down
so that we could cross. I had promised a messmate,
Joe Hungerford, whose home was at Uniontown,
Alabama, that I would spend some time with him.</p>

<p>Riding along one day in Alabama, some miles
from Marion, I was taken with a severe headache,
which forced me to stop and lay up, try to get some
rest and sleep. When I woke in the night I was prevailed
on by an old gentleman at the house, to spend
the balance of the night, which threw me considerably
behind the party of men I was with.</p>

<p>When our party left Greenville Courthouse we
decided if we struck any horses or mules, belonging
to the United States Government, we would take
them along with us, for the purpose of probably raising
money to pay our expenses home and if we found
any small parties of the enemy, we would attack
them and on their surrender, would parole them,
taking their arms and horses.</p>

<p>On riding into the town of Marion, I saw a guard
in front of a livery stable, rode up to him, when he
accosted me, “Hello, Texas; have you come after
mules, too?” I told him, “Yes, where are they?”
He said, “This stable is full of the finest kind of
mules;” he happened to be an Arkansas man and
told me that my party, who went through the day
before, went out with a lot of mules, each leading
two. I told him, “All right, open the door and I
will go in and get a couple.” He said, “No, you
know I want you to have them, but they are in
charge of Major Curry, who has a strong guard here
and is waiting to turn them over to the Yankees,
who are expected in here by train every minute and
you had better not attempt to take any mules by
yourself, as Curry, with his guards, would surely
arrest you and turn you over to the Yankees.” Then
I concluded best to drop the matter and proceeded
to get directions, from a citizen, to Uniontown.</p>

<p>Stopping on the road, about five miles from
Marion, to get dinner, I found at the house four
Confederate soldiers—one young man on crutches,
who had been wounded in the Virginia Army, the
son of the owner of the place; one of the Eleventh
Texas Cavalry and two Arkansas men. At the dinner
table the old gentleman told me about Major
Curry, a Confederate Quartermaster, who had impressed
about two hundred fine mules in that section
for account of the Confederate Government and
had these mules in a large livery stable in Marion,
protected by a guard, to turn them over to the Federals.
These mules had not been branded and the
owners had plead with Major Curry to return them
to them, but Curry refused, claiming it would get
him into trouble with the Federals, as they would
certainly get the information. The old gentleman
told me that the feeling against Curry was very
bitter and that he was regarded as a very mean man,
persisting in his determination to turn over the
mules, on account of his antipathy to his old neighbors
and friendliness to the Federals, thereby courting
their favors.</p>

<p>Presently one of the Arkansas men proposed that
we go back and take a couple of mules apiece, by
force, to which we all consented. Our crippled man,
not having a gun, his father told him of a rich neighbor
some two miles from there who had quite a number
of mules taken by Curry and was very bitter
against him on that account, that he had a very fine
shotgun and would no doubt loan it to him for the
purpose of a raid on that stable. Stopping at this
house on our way into Marion, this young crippled
man secured the shotgun, when we moved on. Just
before we entered town I stopped the party and told
them that I was satisfied we were very liable to have
trouble with Major Curry and there was no use in
starting into it without going through with it.
“Now, if there is a man among you that don’t want
to go in, let him say so now.” They all said they
were willing to go and wanted me to take command
of the party. I told them, “All right, now, if you
are asked any questions, who I am, tell them I am
Lieutenant Jones, Company C, Eleventh Texas.”</p>

<p>We now started in and found a big lattice door
to the stable open, and as soon as we came in sight
the guard rushed to the door to close it, when I dashed
up with my pistol on and told him to leave that
door open. I then told our crippled young man,
with the shotgun, to hold that door open, to stay
there and to shoot the first man that attempted to
close it when the balance of our men went in
to get the mules. There were two shed rooms, connected
with the main room; the large room had stalls
on each side. Not finding any good mules in the
large room, I went to the far end and turned into
one of the shed rooms, the balance of the men scattering
around, hunting good mules. While engaged
untying a mule in the shed room, I heard a man call
to some of our men, “Who are you, and what are
you doing here?” They told him they had come
after mules. “Who commands this party?” “Lieutenant
Jones of the Eleventh Texas.” “Where is
Lieutenant Jones?” They told him I was in that
shed room. In the meantime, a number of men in
citizen’s clothes, had entered the main room. Major
Curry came around into the shed room, where I had
untied a mule and asked me if I was Lieutenant
Jones, in command. He said, “I am Major Curry
of the Confederate States Army, in charge of these
mules, with orders to turn them over to the United
States Army and if you don’t take your party out
of here and leave these mules, I will have to arrest
you and turn you over to the Federal authorities.”
I told him that we would be very much disappointed
if he didn’t attempt our arrest, that we had come
on purpose to get the mules and him, too, when he
approached very near me and said in a low tone of
voice, “You know this stable is full of Yankee spies
now, come in advance of the army to find out what
they can, and for their benefit I have to make a show
of resistance.” He said, “You go ahead and take
what mules you want. You Texans are entitled to
them; you are a long ways from home.”</p>

<p>We then completed our selection and led out two
mules apiece, with two for our lame friend at the
door, passing by a number of strangers, looking on,
in the main room. Major Curry followed me outside,
when I told him, “Now, if it will be of any benefit
to you, Major, I am willing to give you a written
statement that I appeared here with an armed force
and took possession of so many mules,” which he said
he would appreciate very much, it might prove of
benefit to him with the Yankees, and invited me
up into his office with him, around on the square,
where I drew up this statement and signed the name
of R. F. Jones, Company C, Eleventh Texas Regiment.
We then departed with our mules, back to
the young lame man’s home, where we separated,
perhaps never to meet again.</p>

<p>After obtaining directions for Uniontown, on my
way through Green County, Alabama, I stopped at
the little town of Newbern, where I met a Doctor
James Webb, who insisted on my stopping with him.
He had a beautiful home; his family being away on a
long visit to some other section of the State, he felt
quite lonely and wanted company. I decided to accept
his invitation, when he made me feel at home
and my visit there for nearly two months, waiting
for the Mississippi River to run down, proved very
pleasant indeed, besides forming many new and
pleasant acquaintances.</p>

<p>After spending nearly two months at this place,
we had information, which we considered reliable,
that the Trans-Mississippi Department had surrendered.
I therefore concluded best to abandon my
ride to Texas, leave my horse and arms with Doctor
Webb and proceed to New Orleans, from there by
steamer to Galveston. Doctor Webb succeeded in
finding an only twenty-dollar gold piece, which he
advanced me to pay the expense of my trip.</p>

<p>Armed with a parole, copied from one in the possession
of an Appomattox prisoner, I proceeded to
Uniontown, where I took rail for Selma and entered
the Provost Marshal’s office, threw down my parole
and demanded transportation to Texas, which was
granted me as far as New Orleans.</p>

<p>Arriving at New Orleans I found that the Trans-Mississippi
Department had not yet surrendered, but
the agents of General Kirby Smith, who was in command
of the Trans-Mississippi Department (Doctor
Ashbel Smith and Mr. Ballinger of Galveston), were
then negotiating with General Canby, its surrender.
Here I found a large part of Hood’s brigade, as also
General Hood and members of his staff from Texas
and General Thomas Harrison of our brigade, with
some few members of the Eighth Texas, also many
members of Granbury’s and Rector’s brigades,
awaiting the close of negotiations and transportation
to Texas, when finally, in about a week or ten
days, the surrender of the Trans-Mississippi Department
was completed and a large transport, in charge
of a Federal captain, was ordered to take us to Galveston.</p>

<p>On arrival at the entrance of Galveston Bay we
met a sloop of war going out, when our captain in
charge signaled to it to return to Galveston and
anchor off a certain wharf, where he expected to
land our men, which he did. On arrival at this
wharf, after tying up the boat, a stage was run out,
when a lone gentleman standing on the wharf,
claiming to be Mayor Leonard of the city, called
to the Federal captain not to allow a single man to
come off that boat until the trains were ready to
take us into the interior. This brought forth a
spirited rebuke by our Federal captain, telling him
that the men were going to land and stay in the
city until they could be taken out by the railroad
and if they mistreated any of the men while there,
he would order the gunboat to lay his town in ashes.</p>

<p>In explanation of the Mayor’s action, it seems
that when the army disbanded in the interior, that
a lot of bad men entered Galveston and conducted
themselves badly, when the City Council met and
passed an order that no more soldiers would be permitted
in the city. The Mayor, of course, had no
idea that a large number of the men aboard were
citizens of Galveston nor as to the character of the
men aboard, hence his mistake.</p>

<p>In connection with this I recall the departure of
the Bayou City Guards in 1861 for Virginia, who
afterwards constituted a part of the Fifth Texas
Regiment, Hood’s brigade, and reflected such credit
on the Confederate arms in Virginia. I happened to
be present in Houston when this company, marching
through the streets of Houston to the railroad depot,
were escorted by a cavalry company and a large concourse
of citizens—on their departure for Harrisburg,
there to be mustered into the service of the
Confederate States for the war.</p>

<p>After boarding the train a few speeches were
made and a few words spoken by Captain John G.
Walker, commanding the cavalry company, which I
well remember, as follows:</p>

<p>“If you fight bravely we will honor you; if you
return safely we will welcome you; if you die in battle
I swear to Heaven we will avenge you.”</p>

<p>Taking this in connection with our reception at
Galveston, which of course, was a mistake, by accident,
we can well afford to pass it.</p>

<p>As soon as the trains were made up for the interior,
after spending a day and night in Galveston
where we were treated royally by its citizens, we
proceeded to our different homes and I soon landed
in Hempstead among a sad, dejected and ruined people,
resolved to do the best they could under the
circumstances and submit gracefully to the powers
that were.</p>

<p>It would, I consider, be entirely fitting for me
to close this part of my life’s history by publishing
what I may call General Joseph Wheeler’s farewell
address to his cavalry corps (General Wheeler issued
the following order to his entire command):</p>

<div class='chapter'><h2>PREFACE</h2></div>

<p>For the unpleasant facts recorded in this, I am
not responsible, but only the powers that were then.
I would much prefer to forget as I have forgiven,
and not reopen old wounds, but a sacred duty I owe
my family forces me to submit the unvarnished truth
and use expressions, though harsh, to properly represent
conditions as they existed, to protect my lifetime
fair name and character, which I must leave my
family untarnished, and also to redeem my promise
to them and my many interested friends, who were
personally acquainted with me during the years of
this terrible experience.</p>

<p>Do not fail to bear in mind that this is written
altogether from memory, nearly fifty years after it
occurred, hence dates are omitted.</p>

<p>In order to give the reader a full appreciation
of my remarkable preservation and escape from being
murdered by the powers that ruled at the time, I
treat the subject as I do. Drifting into this trouble
was certainly not of my own choice, but altogether
owing to conditions and surroundings. I was simply
the instrument in God’s hands to relieve a law abiding
and submissive community of a terrible calamity
about to be enacted by a lawless band of marauders
in the uniform of the United States, protected by
their officers and permitted by the, then, General
Government, and my life was spared by the interposition
of a Divine Providence. It was this firm
conviction that gave me strength and hope that all
would be well and enabled me to pass through this
terrible ordeal.</p>

<p>There was no law to protect or appeal to, only
the whim of a vindictive military satrap, whose order
was supreme and who regarded the best citizens
of the country fit subjects for his vengeance and
persecution.</p>

<p>Our State Government, organized under the
terms of our surrender, composed of the best and
most solid element of the State, working in conjunction
with the returned Confederate soldiers to rehabilitate
our ruined homes, was ruthlessly set aside
by the infamous order of General Sheridan, as an
impediment to reconstruction.</p>

<p>To longer submit to such conditions and subject
our families to dangers worse than death, made men
desperate and called forth every spark of manhood
in man, particularly in one who had followed Sherman’s
march through Georgia and the Carolinas and
made him liable to resent outrages when brought
directly to his own home in the most effective way,
regardless of consequences.</p>

<p>As a result of our action, having removed the
bandit leader from among them, our community was
no longer subjected to their deviltry. They were
completely overawed and behaved themselves forever
after, thereby avoiding much bloodshed. Had
they burned Hempstead that night, which no doubt
they would have done, an outraged citizenship would
have gathered and visited vengeance on these devils
incarnate and no promise of General Sheridan, as in
the case of Brenham, could have stayed them, then
what would have been the result?</p>

<p>I had the sympathy of the best citizens of the
country, offers of men and money, which were
always declined in the interest of peace.</p>

<p>To better explain the cause for the conditions
existing with these garrisons: When the Federal
Government sent their recruiting agents abroad,
they accepted some of the worst element in Europe,
as well as in this country, promising them large
bounties, good wages and treatment, and all they
could capture, hence a certain element in the army
started in for plunder only, and with no other object.
Some garrisons in the State had a band of
plunderers with a desperate leader, as was the case
at Brenham when it was burned and again at Hempstead
at this time.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the war the best element in
the Federal Army, the brave and gallant men who
won the fight, did not re-enlist, but returned to their
homes to engage in peaceful pursuits and could
never have been induced to assist in degrading their
own race and color by elevating the negro over us,
which was the avowed intention of the fanatical element
of the North who were responsible for the
war.</p>

<p>That gallant soldier and conscientious gentleman,
General W. S. Hancock, in command of New
Orleans, refused to do their bidding and was immediately
superseded by General Sheridan, who
proved a fit tool in their hands.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>Upon My Return From the Army I Find My Business Affairs in Bad Shape.</span></h2></div>

<p>I returned from Johnston’s army, surrendered in
North Carolina in the summer of 1865, to my home
town, Hempstead, Texas, where I found my brother,
six years younger than myself, who had also just
returned from the army, and a younger sister, who
had been boarding at a friend’s house during my
absence in the army. We were orphan children.</p>

<p>On my return I found the business of Faddis &amp;
Graber, which I left in charge of R. P. Faddis, the
senior partner, totally vanished. I had not even a
change of clothing, of which I had left a trunk full.
Brother had given them to needy Confederate soldiers.</p>

<p>After resting and recuperating for some months,
a guest at the homes of different friends, awaiting
an opportunity for business, I was persuaded by an
old friend, Mr. Leander Cannon, to make my home
at his house at Courtney, Grimes County, until I
could secure something to do. Mr. Cannon before
the war had the largest general mercantile business
in the interior of the State, while I kept his books
for him at Hempstead before I entered into business
on my own account with Faddis, Mr. Cannon having
sold out in the meantime.</p>

<p>After the return of the Confederate soldiers from
the army, the first year, they were engaged in peaceable
pursuits, trying to rebuild their lost fortunes
and also to recuperate their health, which, in many
instances, had been sacrificed in the army.</p>

<p>While so engaged, the Federal Government organized
its Freedman’s Bureau, establishing its
agencies in all the populous negro districts in the
State, supported by the army. As heretofore stated,
among these garrisons were a lot of desperate and
bad men, bent on rapine and plunder, and they had
the sanction of their officers, notably in the case of
the town of Brenham, which they sacked and burned.</p>

<p>This aroused the resentment and desperation of
the best people of Texas and very soon a thousand
or more of the best citizens of the State collected
and determined to wipe out this garrison. General
Sheridan, in command of Texas and Louisiana, with
headquarters at New Orleans, telegraphed Governor
Throckmorton to proceed there at once and beg the
people to desist and not to take any action until he
could send a commission to investigate and secure
the guilty parties for punishment.</p>

<p>Governor Throckmorton succeeded in dispersing
this avenging host, and General Sheridan, instead of
sending a commission, reinforced the garrison and
arrested some of the best citizens of the country.</p>

<p>The Hempstead garrison also had a band of
marauders, headed by a desperate character, who occasionally
attacked citizens at night and robbed
them. This was the condition at Hempstead.</p>

<p>In the meantime I started a small general merchandise
business at Courtney, with the assistance of
my friend Cannon. While boarding at Cannon’s
house I occupied a room with a Mr. White and son,
from Tarrant County, who were there, ostensibly,
to trade a flouring mill he had in Tarrant County for
one of Cannon’s Brazos bottom plantations. I soon
concluded that Mr. White had no flouring mill to
trade and was imposing upon Mr. Cannon for his
and his son’s board and also to recuperate his horses.</p>

<p>I also met at Mr. Cannon’s ex-Governor Morehead
of Kentucky, who was then a refugee from the
General Government. While rooming with Mr.
White and his son, we had frequent discussions
about the battles in Virginia, he claiming that he
had served in that army, and his son on General
Johnston’s staff. I noticed that Mr. Cannon showed
these gentlemen a great deal of attention and frequently
these three were seen in the woods, sitting
on a log, talking. I was puzzled to know why it was
that Mr. Cannon could be so easily imposed on by
this man White.</p>

<p>Some months or more after they had left, and I
had moved to the hotel down in town, I met Mr.
Cannon on the street and he said to me, “I have
just heard from Mr. White.” “Well, has he sold
his flouring mill?” I asked. Cannon said, “No, you
knew he had no flouring mill. You knew that it
was General Wigfall and his son, Holsey.” I told
him no, that I was unaware who he was, having only
met General Wigfall one time at Raleigh, North
Carolina, at a hotel, when he wore a heavy black
beard, and at Courtney he was clean shaven. Cannon
told me, when he heard from them, they were
in Havana and would take a steamer the next day
for Great Britain. I never knew what became of
ex-Governor Morehead after he left Cannon’s, but do
not think that he was ever arrested.</p>

<p>While at Courtney, I was called on by an old
comrade, Ben Polk, in company with a friend of his
by the name of T. J. Thorn, who were looking for a
large plantation to lease. This they failed to find.
Both had their old family set of negroes to work
for them. Ben Polk went over on the Trinity, where
he rented and cultivated a plantation, and Captain
Thorn rented the Stevenson’s Ferry plantation,
about six miles from the town of Hempstead, where
he pitched a large crop of cotton and corn.</p>

<p>Several months after I happened to meet with
Thorn at Hempstead, when he made a proposition to
me to join in the cultivation of this crop, as he felt
financially unable to carry it through.</p>

<p>After investigating his proposition, which was
most liberal, and considering the further fact that
the location presented a better opportunity for business
than Courtney, I decided to accept and moved
down there with my stock of merchandise, boarding
my family in a friend’s home in Hempstead, as the
house on the plantation was in bad repair. Captain
Thorn also boarded his wife and two children with
his father-in-law in Hempstead.</p>

<p>It was our custom to spend Sundays with our
families in town, sometimes going in on Saturday
night, returning Monday morning, and occasionally
going in on Sunday morning.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>The Affair at Hempstead.</span></h2></div>

<p>One Sunday morning Thorn and I rode into town,
and met on the road going towards the river, eleven
Federal soldiers. We thought nothing of it as they
had never before crossed the river. Captain Thorn
stopped at the place where his wife was boarding
and I started across the square to where my little
family were stopping. I noticed a group of our solid
citizens armed, talking excitedly, and rode up and
asked them the news, when they told me that a band
of soldiers had raided the town the night before,
committing a number of depredations and had
threatened to burn Hempstead that night.</p>

<p>A committee of citizens, headed by the Mayor,
Mr. Whitworth, had visited the camp that morning
and complained to the commanding officer, Captain
Lancaster, of the conduct of his men the night before
and told him of their threat to burn Hempstead
that night. They asked permission to organize a
patrol to keep their town from being burned. He
cursed them in answer and told them that he wanted
every one of them to hunt their holes that night at
eight o’clock and that he would have a patrol out
to see that they did it.</p>

<p>Knowing the temper of the people, as I did, I
suggested to them not to do anything rash, telling
them that whatever was done without the authority
of the powers that were would only bring greater
trouble, and that we would be powerless to secure
redress. I pleaded with them and cautioned them
to submit, rather than to make matters worse, as
in the case of Brenham.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to my wife’s place of residence
and spent the balance of the day until about four
o’clock in the evening. All during that day we
heard wild rumors of the threats of the soldiers of
what they were going to do that night and I decided
it was best to take my wife and baby to the plantation
and keep them out of trouble. About a mile
from town I met one of our negro men, with his
wife. His wife’s clothes were badly torn. He told
me that eleven soldiers had been out to the place,
robbed the house of several guns belonging to the
negroes and one very fine gun belonging to Captain
Thorn. They had tried to break into my storeroom,
but had failed to get in. They had then gone to
Buckhorn, about four or five miles west of us, where
there was a store and postoffice, and he thought
on their return, they would break into my store. I
asked him where he was going. He said he was going
into camp to report them. I told him not to
do so, that they would nearly beat him to death for
making such a report, but to go and see his Marse
Tom and tell him what they had done and to tell him
that I had gone on out and to come out immediately
and to bring out a good lot of pistol ammunition.
We both had pistols but no ammunition for them,
never having any use for them, though it was the
custom with most people to carry six-shooters.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to watch their return from
Buckhorn and, on their approach, to go into the
storeroom, well prepared with loaded guns, and resist
any attempt on their part to break into the store.</p>

<p>I drove on out to the place, very much alarmed;
fearing that I would meet these devils on their return
to town, but fortunately, they had not returned
that far. After crossing the river at the ferry, I
drove through the open fields, where I could see clear
up to the house, about a mile, and when I reached
the house the negroes reported that they had already
left there, for town, on the river road, through
a piece of bottom.</p>

<p>I had promised my wife that I would do nothing
in the matter and intended to make good this promise,
but when the negroes told me of the soldiers’
doings in the negro quarters and at the house, I lost
all control of myself, ushered my wife into the house,
told her that I had to go down to the barn to see
the mules fed, by way of an excuse to get away
from her, went into the storeroom, got an only pistol,
partly loaded, rushed to the barn without a
saddle, jumped on my horse’s back and set out in
pursuit of them.</p>

<p>Fortunately they had already crossed the river
when I got to the ferry. There is no question but
what I would have dashed in among them with only
three shots in my pistol and would not now live to
tell the tale.</p>

<p>At the ferry I met a young man by the name of
Stevenson, a son of the owner of the place, and a
young man by the name of Hartsfield, who had been
acting as our overseer. Stevenson was armed and
so was Hartsfield. I got some ammunition from the
ferryman for my pistol, which I completed loading.
When about ready to cross the river, Captain Thorn
hailed for the boat, crossed and secured another pistol
from the ferryman. Thorn was very much stirred
up. In meeting them the leader of this gang had
made him get off of his horse, get down on his knees
and told him to say his prayers, but finally let him
off. We then started in pursuit and when within
about a mile of their camp we caught up with them.
When they heard us coming they broke, their leader
and several companions taking to trees, from which
they fired upon us. In the mix-up they got the worst
of the affair. Two were left dead on the field, while
we miraculously escaped without a scratch.</p>

<p>Our first decision was to report the result to the
commanding officer, but being admonished by the
manner in which he had treated our citizens that
morning, and also the history in the case of Brenham,
we finally concluded we had better keep out
of their clutches and not risk our lives in their
hands.</p>

<p>A military satrap was the law of the land; there
were no courts to appeal to, only the tender mercies
of General Sheridan.</p>

<p>We immediately returned to the river. After
crossing, I asked the party to hold the ferry until
I could get my wife and baby to a friend’s house,
about two miles distant. Hartsfield and Stevenson
both refused and left, but Thorn, taking my pistol,
in addition to the one he had, sat down by a tree
and told me to take my time, that he would hold
that ferryboat against the whole garrison.</p>

<p>I went to the house, took my wife and baby to a
Mr. Waller Cochran’s, where they spent the night,
and then I went back to relieve Captain Thorn.
We then went to another friend’s house, where we
were joined by our overseer, Hartsfield, and there
spent the night. I instructed Mr. John D. Cochran,
an old messmate, to go over to his brother’s place
the next morning, get my wife and baby and either
take them to Courtney to her sister’s home or bring
them to Navasota, where we expected to meet them
the next evening.</p>

<p>In crossing the ferry the next morning there
were in the boat with them twelve men in command
of a lieutenant, heavily armed, who had been out
to the place, searching for us. My wife heard them
make their threats that if they caught up with Thorn
or Graber that they had orders to shoot them down
without benefit of a court martial.</p>

<p>After spending that night at a friend’s house,
we three started for Navasota, on the west side of
the river, Stevenson having left us at the ferry the
day before. I have never seen him since. We crossed
the river at Old Washington and arrived at Navasota
in the evening, where I met my wife, who was
taken to a Mr. Felder’s house.</p>

<p>Our arrival at Navasota created great excitement.
We were visited by many of the best citizens
of the town, some of whom begged us to stay. They
just wanted a chance at them, when they came after
us, but I told them no, that our case was bad enough
and that it would only result in involving our
friends without accomplishing anything, which I
was determined not to do. I therefore arranged to
leave next morning for Waxahachie, where I was
well acquainted, having spent two years of my boyhood
there.</p>

<p>After a day’s reflection we just began to realize
our condition. Outlawed by the powers that were,
everything that we had in the world lost, confiscated,
dependent altogether on what financial aid and assistance
we might accept; and, although we had
abundant aid offered us, it only made us more
desperate. We felt that our fate was sealed, though
we had not a moment’s thought of regret; we felt
that we had done right, that we could not have
done otherwise and were simply the victims of conditions
existing.</p>

<p>I parted with my wife next morning, never expecting
to see her again, telling her whenever she
heard of my being in their hands, it would be my
dead body; I would never surrender.</p>

<p>We now started on our trip to Waxahachie, without
incident, stopping at houses at night, without
disclosing our identity, giving fictitious names.
When we reached Spring Hill we found a Mr. George
H. Porter of Houston, an old army acquaintance of
Thorn’s, who was out collecting for T. W. House of
Houston. We also found a Federal quartermaster
from Waco, out buying horses for the troops stationed
at that point. Now, my friend, Thorn, had
got to drinking very hard, getting more desperate
every day and conceived the idea to hold up this
quartermaster and make him give us his money. I
spurned the idea, telling Thorn that he could not do
it while I was there. I was not willing to turn highway
robber, which it would have amounted to. Here
was the turning point in our lives, especially in the
case of Thorn, who didn’t seem to have any compunctions
in the matter, though, in the eyes of many,
he would have been fully justified. The Government,
through their soldiers, had robbed us of everything
we had and was seeking to take our lives
without the benefit of a court martial, and, under
the circumstances, Thorn’s idea might have been
justified.</p>

<p>My friend Thorn readily yielded when I called
his attention to the disgrace such an act would
bring on our families, to say nothing of having entered
into such practices, which would have carried
us further into an infamous career. To me, the fact
that we had to depend on misrepresentation and
lies to save our lives as long as we could, with a
faint hope of ultimately living out of it, was bad
enough. Lying was revolting to my very nature. I
always detested a liar, as much so as I did a thief,
but in this case, I leave it to the reader whether we
were justified or not.</p>

<p>On parting with Mr. Porter, the next day, he
pulled out a large purse of twenty dollar gold pieces
and offered it to Thorn; told him to take it all, but
I pushed back his hand and told Thorn that he
must not take a dollar of it, as it was money collected
by Porter, belonging to T. W. House. Porter
insisted on him taking some of it; saying that he
could replace it from his salary account, but I said
no, I had good friends at Waxahachie, who would
furnish me whatever money we actually needed.
George A. Porter is still living in Houston and has
built up one of the largest commission businesses in
the place.</p>

<p>We now proceeded to Waxahachie without further
incident and put up at the Rogers House. E.W.
Rogers being an old friend of mine he did his
best to make us feel at home. Here, as stated, I
was known by many of the old citizens and we passed
under our own names. About a week passed, during
which time we watched the daily papers and
read every report from South Texas, expecting daily
pursuit. One day, while in a store across the street
from the Rogers House, old man Rogers came in,
somewhat excited, and told us a man had just got
off the stage at the hotel and registered as “Brown,
from Hempstead.” He thought, from his talk, he
was a Federal and advised us to go over and investigate.
We immediately started across, and noticed
the man in the door. When within about fifteen feet
of him, he recognized me, saying, “Hello, Mr.
Graber; are you here? We thought you were in
Mexico by this time.” I told him, “No, we are
going to Mexico, but not the way you thought we
were.” By this time Thorn had got inside of the
door and said to Brown, “Let me see you a minute,”
and led him into our room. As soon as inside, Thorn
jerked out his pistol, saying, “Get down on your
knees and say your prayers; d—— you, I ‘m going to
kill you.” I quickly pushed his pistol aside, told
him to hold on and let us hear what he had to say;
“if he is here on business, after us, you can take
him.”</p>

<p>The fellow told a straight tale about his business
there, saying that he came to see an aunt of his, who
lived about fifteen miles from Waxahachie, a woman
who was known to me. I told him to get up, that he
was all right and not on business for us. He said
that he never would tell of seeing us there if we
did not want him to do so. He said that he was a
Missourian and had been in the Federal Army; was
wounded at the battle of Elkhorn, in his left wrist,
a bad scar of which he showed us, and said this
brought him to his senses; he quit fighting us and
went into the sutler’s business, to make what money
he could out of them, and came to Hempstead with
the troops in that capacity, though when I became
known to him there, he was a mail clerk in the post
office, though I did not recall his face. He told us,
furthermore, that he was quite intimate with Capt.
Lancaster and had heard Lancaster say that he told
these fellows if they didn’t quit their deviltry somebody
would kill them, but Brown said Lancaster told
him that he had his orders, received from General
Griffin at Galveston, who was then in command of
Texas, and Griffin had orders from General Sheridan
to make an example of us and have us shot down
wherever we were found, without the benefit of a
court martial. I told Brown, when he got back, to
tell Captain Lancaster where he had met us and also
his treatment at our hands and since he, Lancaster,
had orders to show us no quarter, which we didn’t
ask or expect at his hands, and if we should ever
meet up with him I would make it a special point
to get him, like we did the chief desperado at
Hempstead.</p>

<p>Realizing that my friend Thorn had become too
desperate for me to control, especially while drinking,
I determined to cut loose from him, which I felt
justified in doing, as he was then comparatively out
of danger, and I suggested to him to start to California,
where his mother was living. She was
wealthy and able to take care of him and his family
if he could succeed in bringing them out. This he
decided to do. I then borrowed some money and
had a business friend to rig him out in some good
clothes and charge to me. I gave him a very fine
gold watch and chain I had and started him for
California, by way of Kansas City and the Union
Pacific Railroad. I parted with him about two miles
north of Waxahachie, he continuing in that direction
and I turning east, out of sight of the town,
suspecting that we might be watched, as to the direction
we were both going. I forgot to mention that
I exchanged horses with my friend Rogers’ son, for
one of the best saddle horses in the country, and on
this horse, well armed, having four six-shooters (two
in holsters on my saddle and two on my belt), I felt
I could ride all around and through that garrison
in Hempstead, or any pursuing party. I then struck
out for Navasota, with the determination to bring
my wife and baby out, fearing they would arrest
her and hold her as hostage.</p>

<p>Riding along the main road in Freestone County,
about noon, with a severe headache, I discovered a
white house on the prairie, about a mile to the right
of the road and noticing a negro ahead of me, crossing
the road going towards the house, I hurried and
caught up with him. I asked him who lived at that
house. He answered “Marse Dick Oliver,” who
proved to be an old army friend of mine. I rode up
to the house and found my friend Dick at home, and
he introduced me to his family under my real name.
They insisted on me spending the balance of the
day and night with them. Dick said he would send
for several of our old comrades, who lived in that
neighborhood, to come and see me, which he did.
One of them, Bulger Peeples, remained all night
with me.</p>

<p>The next morning Dick made him go to a neighbor’s
and get what money he had, which proved to
be fifty dollars in silver, which he insisted on my
taking before we parted. I hesitated, but finally
accepted it. I now proceeded on down to Navasota,
where I arrived in the morning, early, and went
to the store of an acquaintance, a Mr. Guy. I remained
in his back room all day long, while he sent
to Courtney for my wife and baby to come up and
meet me at Mr. Felder’s that night. We there spent
the whole night with Mr. Felder and his family,
planning what was best to do. I learned that they
had been watching Dr. Hall’s place at Courtney, my
wife’s sister’s home, closely, ever since I left, hoping
to catch me there on a visit. It was decided that
it would be impossible to take them out with me, as
they would, no doubt, exert extra efforts by scattering
troops around immediately, when they found
that she had left home. We finally decided that my
only chance for escape would be to go to Mexico.
Mr. Felder had a brother living in Tuxpan, Mexico,
to whom he gave me a letter of introduction and assured
me that I would be safe with him if I ever
succeeded in reaching there. I also arranged with
my wife to correspond with her by means of an acid,
which can be used as ink, but is invisible until held
up to heat, which brings it out black. I would
then get some friend to write to Dr. Hall, my brother-in-law,
on some business subject. Only a few lines
would be written and when he received our communications
he would understand it and hand the
letter to my wife, who would bring out the acid
writing on the remaining blank of the sheet. In this
letter I would tell her where Dr. Hall could direct
his letter and by that means we kept in communication.</p>

<p>About daylight next morning, during a severe
thunder and rain storm, one of the darkest nights
I was ever out in, Mr. Felder took me through his
field to the Piedmont Springs road, which I followed
by the lightning, as best I could, swimming one
slough, but got safely across the Navasota River
and soon arrived at a house where I decided to stop
and have my clothes dried, take a nap and get some
breakfast.</p>

<p>I called at the house and found the gentleman
very pleasant. I told him I was in trouble and wanted
to stop and get some breakfast and have my
clothes dried. He very cordially invited me in, loaned
me a change of his clothes, while his wife dried my
clothing and prepared some breakfast for me, during
which time I took a nap. I then left the house, refreshed,
and started on to Centerville, Leon County.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXV<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>I Narrowly Escape Capture.</span></h2></div>

<p>Before parting with Thorn at Waxahachie, he
told me if ever I happened to be in the upper part
of Grimes County, to hunt for a man by the name
of Camp, who was an old California friend of his
father, having gone there with him in 1848. “You
only need to tell him who you are, that you are associated
with me in this trouble and he will do all he
can for you.” I had nearly forgotten Thorn’s
mentioning this, when I rode up to a house
late in the evening, that seemed to me perhaps a
stage stand. I decided to stop and stay all night
there, calling at the gate. An old gentleman came
out, to whom I told my business, and he told me,
“Certainly you can stay; I am keeping a public
house;” furthermore saying, “You walk right in,
take a seat on the porch, supper will be ready directly;
I will take your horse down to the barn and
feed him.” His barn was some three hundred yards
down the lane and across the road. I walked in,
took a seat on the porch and very soon was called
in to supper. I found at the table his wife and
daughter and a gentleman traveler, who, in conversation
with the ladies, stated that he had passed
two companies of troops from Hempstead, coming
on, and saying that they were nearly due there. I
made out a hasty supper, immediately went down
to the barn and told Mr. Camp I must have my horse
right quick; told him who I was, by way of explanation
why it was urgent for me to get my horse at
once. He, of course, was surprised, and told me anything
under the sun he could do for me, not to hesitate
to demand it; said that he would go to the house
and talk with this man and ascertain whether these
troops were infantry or cavalry; furthermore, if
they were infantry they were on their way to Centerville,
where they had been expected for some
time, to garrison that town. He says, “If they are
infantry, they are evidently not after you and don’t
know you are here; then you have got to stay all
night with me and rest; you will be perfectly safe.
I will put you in a room where there will be no
danger to my family, in case anything should happen.
I have a good shotgun that I will know how to
use in your defense.”</p>

<p>I told Mr. Camp that I had promised my wife
on parting with her, that I wouldn’t recognize the
best friend I met anywhere, let no one know who
I was and made him promise not to tell this man
nor his family. He soon came back to the barn,
while I was watching the road that these troops
were on, and reported they were infantry, on their
way to Centerville and made me leave my horse and
go back to the house with him. These troops camped
within about a quarter of a mile, at the mouth of
his lane, and came to his house for milk, butter and
chickens, while I was in bed asleep.</p>

<p>He gave me an early breakfast next morning and
I started on with this gentleman, who Camp assured
me was a particular friend of Tom Thorn’s and
would fight for me, if he knew who I was. I told
him that I did not intend to make myself known
to him. We rode on together for about six miles,
when we struck a creek, out of its banks. He suggested
to me that he knew a foot log not far above
there, where we could cross with our saddles and
riggings; he would drive in his mare and she would
cross and my horse would follow her, which he did.
As soon as his mare got on the other side, she went
flying up the road, with my horse following. He
said he was satisfied that some friend of his would
stop her somewhere on the road and we would hurry
on afoot and try to get her, also my horse, and I had
nothing to do but accept the situation. I spent
nearly two anxious hours, watching the road in the
direction in which the troops were coming, when
he finally came up, leading my horse. We then saddled
up and proceeded on our way and upon reaching
the forks of the road, one leading to Centerville,
the other to Leona, we parted; I taking the Leona
road, which was called the old San Antonio road
to Shreveport. I continued on this road, day and
night, until I reached Marshall, where I found an
old prison friend by the name of Fisher, who lived
about a mile from the town and he insisted on my
going out to his house to remain until I could take
boat at Shreveport for New Orleans.</p>

<p>I spent several days with him, going up town,
making my headquarters at the office of Ochiltree &amp;
Shaw. I was acquainted with Judge Ochiltree,
whose son, Bill, was a public auctioneer. I turned
him over my horse and saddle to sell at auction.
While he was riding around the streets, crying the
horse for sale to the highest bidder, he stopped in
front of the office, called me to the door, said he was
offered one hundred forty-eight and one-half dollars
and that he had met a Federal lieutenant, who was
stuck on the horse and he was going to make him
pay two hundred dollars for him before he quit. I
told him not to take another bid from him, as I did
not want any Federal to ride that horse, so he had
to sell him at one hundred forty-eight and one-half
dollars.</p>

<p>I was now ready to move and, on investigation,
found that two boats would leave Shreveport for
New Orleans on Wednesday evening and on that
day I went down to Shreveport to take passage on
one of these boats. On arrival at Shreveport the stewards
of these boats came aboard of the train and
announced that the boats had failed to receive sufficient
cotton to justify starting on the trip and had
postponed sailing until the next Friday and if there
were any passengers aboard, for New Orleans, they
could go aboard of the boats at once and save hotel
bills for several days, which I decided to do.</p>

<p>After registering on the “Bart-Able,” which was
the finest boat on the river, I took a seat on the
guards, the front of the passenger deck, and awaited
for what would next turn up. Very soon a party
of four men came aboard, whom I took to be gamblers.
I was soon recognized by one of the party,
who proved to be Ike Hutchison, who started
out in the army with us, but was a professional
gambler, a class of people I never had much use for.
During the short time he was with us in our company,
I treated him somewhat indifferently, which
might have resulted seriously at this time. As soon as
recognized by him, he came forward, grasped my
hand, was very glad to see me and started to introduce
me to his companions, when I drew him near
me and whispered in his ear, “Jones—” He caught
on, and introduced me to his companions as “Mr.
Jones.” We then entered into a general conversation,
took a drink together at the bar, when we both
made it convenient to draw away from the crowd,
out of hearing, when he asked, “What’s the matter,
Henry?” I told him of my troubles, that I had
the whole Federal Army hunting me to take my life,
and that I was going down to New Orleans to try to
get some sailboat for Mexico. He seemed surprised
at my statement and told me that he was in the
Government Secret Service, drew back his coat and
showed me his badge, but said earnestly that I need
not be apprehensive on that account; that he
wouldn’t betray me. I told him, “Ike, my life is in
your hands and I depend on your promise, but if
you do betray me, some of my friends will get you.”
He next told me that Lieutenant Black, an ex-member
of our regiment, was at the Southwestern Printing
Office, a commercial editor of the paper, and
that I ought to go up and see him. He said he knew
Black would be glad to see me. With this information
I parted with him and went up and found my
friend Black who, of course, was greatly surprised
at my statement of my condition. When I expressed
my fears about Hutchison betraying me, he said he
did not believe that Ike would do that, but, studying
a few moments, he said, “Now, if Ike does betray
you and you are arrested, bring them up here;
I have more influence than Ike. While I would not
do such a thing for any other purpose, and would
rather have my right hand cut off, but to save your
life, I am willing to swear that Hutchison is mistaken
and that you are ‘Mr. Jones.’ This will give
us time enough to get a couple of good horses, which
we will mount and go off together.”</p>

<p>Considering this proposition, realizing the enormity
of the step he was about to take to save my
life, from a lucrative and valuable position, commanding
the esteem and confidence of the entire
business community at Shreveport, to join me in becoming
an outlaw, I consider he was one of the
grandest and noblest characters that I have ever
known and, at this writing, I regret to have to report
that he has long since passed over the river,
having died in Houston in the late seventies, a victim
of consumption, and I was deprived of the pleasure
of ever seeing him afterwards.</p>

<p>At the supper table that night I found only a
little group of passengers aboard; two young ladies,
one about twelve and the other about eighteen years
old, a gentleman, whom I took to be their brother,
wearing a mustache like my own, just about my age
and size, and the captain of the boat, who sat between
us, at the head of the table.</p>

<p>From their conversation I learned that these
young ladies’ mother was aboard and was sick.
After supper I went forward, took a seat on the
guards and had a smoke.</p>

<p>The next morning I found only the two young
ladies at the table for breakfast. Having planned
to try to get access to the ladies’ end of the cabin
during the trip, thereby avoiding the men aboard,
I decided to form the acquaintance of these two
young ladies and their brother and for this purpose
entered into conversation with them, inquiring
about the condition of their mother. While engaged
in conversation, eating breakfast and sitting with
my back to the front part of the cabin, I heard
stateroom doors slamming behind me and, in looking
around to ascertain the cause, found a policeman
opening every door and looking in under the
berths. Looking still further around I found six
more policemen in the front end of the cabin, standing
talking. This first man mentioned, continued
his search in the staterooms, one after the other,
until he passed us about two doors, then looked
around and stared at me. I asked him, “Do you
wish anything, sir?” He says, “Yes, sir; I am looking
for a man about your size and appearance.”
“Well, take a seat, sir!” I replied, “I will talk with
you as soon as I finish breakfast.” He did not take
a seat, but went back forward and joined the other
policemen.</p>

<p>On the spur of the moment, I, of course, concluded
that they were after me and, having resolved
never to surrender, I started to run into my stateroom
close by, get out my two pistols and start to
shooting, but on a further reflection, was puzzled
to know if they were after me. I could not understand
why civil officers should be sent after me in
place of soldiers, of which there were a good many
in Shreveport. Then, I remembered the young man
at the table the night before, and thought that they
perhaps were after him and if through a mistake I
should kill some of these civil officers, who no doubt
had families and may have been Confederate soldiers,
I would feel badly. I reconsidered by resolution
and went forward to talk out of it, if they were
after me, and with the assistance of my friend,
Black, I believed I would have no trouble in doing
so.</p>

<p>I walked up to this officer, who had spoken to
me and said, “Now, I am ready to talk to you, sir.”
He answered, “I beg your pardon; you are not the
man we are after, but he is aboard here and we have
just learned where he can be found.” I said: “All
right, I am going up to the Southwestern Printing
Office to see a friend and, if you do decide that
I am the man you are hunting, you will find me at
that place for the next hour.”</p>

<p>I then went up and spent an hour with my friend
Black. When returning to the boat I met the police
officer on the stairs, coming down, and he said to me,
“We have found our man; he was in that woman’s
stateroom, under her berth.” I asked him why he was
arrested. He said he did not know, only there was
a requisition from the Governor of Georgia for him.
It seems the sheriff’s office had been abolished by the
military, the sheriff removed from office as an impediment
to reconstruction, and this was the reason
this business was turned over to the city police department.</p>

<p>When I reached the cabin guards, I found the
young ladies crying and asked them what was the
matter. They told me that Colonel So-and-So, an old
acquaintance of theirs, had just been arrested, but
they did not know for what cause. It seems that
these ladies and their mother lived in Louisiana, not
far from New Orleans, and had been on a visit to
Henderson, Texas, and were just returning home.
It is hardly necessary to say that I kept shy of these
folks the balance of the trip.</p>

<p>The next day I met up with an old gentleman by
the name of Wilkerson from Columbia County,
Georgia, who had been to Tyler, Texas, for the purpose
of getting his son, who had been acting deputy
sheriff, and had got in some trouble. I found the
old gentleman a true Southern man, expressing his
unreserved sympathy for the fallen South and denouncing
in bitter terms the crime of reconstruction,
as carried on. Needing some one to talk to and
confide in, I had no hesitancy in making a confidant
of him, which immediately enlisted his sympathy
and kind interest and, without hesitation, he extended
me an urgent invitation to go with him and make
his house my home, saying that the armies had never
touched his section of the State; they had got his
negroes, but he had plenty of everything left and
as long as he had a morsel left he would divide it
with me. He further said whenever it was safe to
send for my family, to do so, and we could stay at
his home where we would be most welcome by all
of his own family, besides himself, his wife, daughter
and two sons, until I got out of my trouble.</p>

<p>Before reaching Marshall I had decided not to
go to Mexico and place myself out of mail communication
with my wife, but to go to Memphis,
Tennessee, to see General Forrest, with whom I was
well acquainted, having served under him in the
early part of his career. I wanted to ask him to
secure some kind of business for me, then to smuggle
my family there and remain until the military
were withdrawn.</p>

<p>On a further consideration of Mr. Wilkerson’s
generous offer, especially the feature of being isolated
away from any town and public travel, I decided
I had better accept, which I had no hesitancy
in doing and on our arrival at New Orleans, we took
a boat for Mobile, thence by rail to Atlanta and his
station in Columbia County, somewhere between
Atlanta and Augusta.</p>

<p>My reception at the Wilkerson home by the rest
of his family, especially his wife and daughter, after
learning of my troubles, was most cordial and unreserved
and certainly they tried to make me feel
at home and forget my trouble during my stay of
six weeks. It was here that I received my first letter
from home. After six weeks, doing nothing, having
nothing to occupy my mind, I decided that I ought
to do something more than kill valuable time and
try and get into business somewhere, where I might
make a new start in life. For this purpose I requested
Mr. Wilkerson to give me a letter of introduction
to his commission merchant in Augusta, Georgia,
where I must try and get into business. The
whole family tried to persuade me to not take such
a great risk. I, nevertheless, parted with them with
expressions of my high appreciation of their kind
interest in my behalf and proceeded to Augusta,
armed with Mr. Wilkerson’s letter of introduction
to the commission merchant, whose name I have forgotten.</p>

<p>On arrival at Augusta I put up at the best hotel
and, I forgot to mention, having assumed the name
of James E. Smith while at Mr. Wilkerson’s, I registered
under this name. Having to pay five dollars
per day for board and room, I decided that I must
get a cheaper place, some good boarding house if
possible. Presenting my letter of introduction to
Mr. Wilkerson’s commission merchant, they stated
they were not making a living for themselves, which
was the condition of most of the business houses in
Augusta, as some of the rich people in the country
were sending in and drawing rations. These gentlemen
then referred me to the only good boarding
house they knew of which was reasonable in their
rates. It was kept by Mrs. Oakman on Green Street,
where I called and was informed by the lady that
she could board me, but had only one place for me
to sleep and that was in a room with two double
beds in it, one of which had only one man sleeping
in it, a printer and ex-Confederate soldier from
Macon; if I was willing to sleep with him, she could
take me and to which I agreed.</p>

<p>At the supper table that night I was shown a
seat by a one-legged Federal captain, who was the
Provost-Marshal of the place. When I entered my
room that night I was introduced by my bedfellow
to a Mr. Rice of Syracuse, New York, and a telegraph
official, whose name I have forgotten, both
occupying the other bed.</p>

<p>I found that Mr. Rice had been sent there by
Henry A. Wilson of Massachusetts, the ex-Vice President
of the United States, and Kelley of Pennsylvania,
who were touring the South inciting the
negroes to riot and murder of the whites, which will
be remembered by the Mobile riot, which surpassed
perhaps all the other places they visited.</p>

<p>Rice had instructions to buy out the Augusta
Chronicle and Constitution, perhaps the most influential
Democratic paper in Georgia and run it in
the interest of the Radical Party, the object being
to create a strong sentiment among the negroes and
stimulate their hatred toward their old masters and
the white race generally, and also to keep the scalawag
white element of the country well in line with
their fanatical scheme of making a finish of the
South.</p>

<p>While stopping here I claimed to be an ex-Confederate
soldier from Tennessee, seeking employment.
I had frequent discussions with Rice about
the causes of the war and especially its cruel conduct
by the Lincoln Government, which he approved
unhesitatingly, saying that we deserved no better
and he had come down here for the purpose of getting
a slice of what was left. He said that he expected
to make a cool hundred thousand and go back
home and live on it for the balance of his days, in
peace and plenty. On one occasion in our discussions,
he seemed to get mad and said if he had his
way about it, he would hang the last d—— one of us
and commence by hanging Jeff Davis. He had
hardly finished the sentence when I had a chair over
his head and if it had not been caught by the telegraph
official, I would likely have knocked him
senseless.</p>

<p>On another occasion, when he was organizing his
publishing force, he offered me the position of mailing
clerk at a salary of $75.00 per month, which I
turned down contemptuously, telling him that whenever
I got ready to go to the dogs, I would affiliate
with his sort. He said he thought he ought to have
one good Rebel in his office. Now, I do not recall
whether he succeeded in buying out the Chronicle
and Constitution, or brought on new material for his
paper.</p>

<p>After spending a few days in Augusta, I found
that one of my old commanders, General Lafayette
McLaws, was then acting clerk of the Superior
Court, with his office at the court house. I scouted
for General McLaws from Savannah, Georgia, to
Bentonville, North Carolina, and immediately called
upon him. I found him wearing his old Confederate
gray, with buttons and trimmings shorn off, and in
conversation, referred to his love of the old uniform,
still preferring it, but he said it was not a matter of
choice, but a matter of necessity. He had a large
dependent family and his fee, or salary, hardly furnished
him sufficient means for a decent support; besides,
he expected to be ousted most any day, as the
Radical sheriff, whose name I have forgotten, and
Foster Blodgett, the mayor of the city, a renegade
ex-Confederate major of artillery, would no doubt,
succeed in their efforts to oust him. It is hardly
necessary to say that during my stay here of several
months, I made him daily visits and had a most
pleasant, but sad, intercourse with him. He seemed
to be at a loss as to his future; said he was educated
a soldier, which he had always been and never tried
to make a living as a civilian, in fact, didn’t know
anything else. He had an urgent invitation from
General Pope, he said, who was in command of
Georgia, with headquarters at Atlanta, and who was
an old classmate of his at West Point, to make him
a visit, but was almost afraid to accept, fearing unjust
criticism by leading men of the State of Georgia,
who would suspect that the object of this visit
was to get office and join the Radical band. This
he never expected to do, though the State of Georgia
had treated him badly and especially his rich acquaintances,
at one time friends, and he seemed
to feel he was an outcast with no prospect of ever
re-entering the army, therefore, not knowing what
to do.</p>

<p>He declined the visit to General Pope, with due
and proper thanks, but, after a few years, during
General Grant’s administration, was appointed marshal
of the Southern District of Georgia and subsequently,
by some other administration, postmaster
of the city of Savannah, Georgia, in which position,
he died. I had several nice letters from him while
postmaster at Savannah; one just before his death.</p>

<p>I never cultivated or had much to say to our
one-legged captain, the Provost-Marshal of the
place, and in a few days, induced Mrs. Oakman to
give me a seat at another table, thereby keeping my
distance. No one at Augusta, Georgia, ever knew
my secret but General McLaws, nor ever suspected
anything wrong.</p>

<p>After spending nearly two months in Augusta,
with no prospect of any business of any character,
and having received notice from my wife that it was
thought that they had got on my track, I concluded
best to leave there for Lebanon, Tennessee, where I
formed some pleasant acquaintances during the war,
notably Captain James Britton, commanding a company
from that town, called the Cedar Snags, which
formed a part of the Fourth Tennessee Regiment.
Captain Britton advised me to stay there until it
became too dangerous, as quite a number of people
knew me and I had to retain my own name in order
to keep down discussion of my case among these
people that knew me, thereby making it too public
if I had assumed another name.</p>

<p>At Lebanon I found the family of General Anderson,
whose son, Dewitt, became an intimate
friend of mine, while in the army. He insisted on
my spending a couple of weeks at his father’s ranch,
about five miles out on the Nashville pike, which I
decided to do. In the meantime, I was introduced
by Captain Britton to Judge Green, the Dean of
the great Law School at Lebanon, also to ex-Governor
Campbell, and the Motley brothers, bankers,
over whose bank I roomed with Captain Britton
and boarded at Mr. Toliver’s, his brother-in-law.
The above mentioned gentlemen, except Mr. Toliver
and General Anderson, were influential, strong Union
men during the war, but on account of the
fanatical reconstruction policy, had just turned
Rebels. I confided my trouble to ex-Governor
Campbell and Judge Green and was assured by
Governor Campbell that if I ever had the misfortune
to be captured and my life was spared before my
case could reach Washington, he would personally
proceed to Washington, being an intimate friend of
President Johnson’s, and intercede to have my life
spared.</p>

<p>I finally went down to the Anderson ranch to
fish and hunt squirrels, in company with Dewitt, and
found the old gentleman in charge, he preferring
the ranch to his home in Lebanon. Returning from
a hunt one day, alone, I found a horse at the gate
and was met by Dewitt before reaching the gate,
anxious to explain the object of the visitor’s presence
and especially his character.</p>

<p>Dewitt stated that he was a captain, whose name
I have forgotten, who commanded a company in
Stokes’ Regiment, a notorious renegade; Captain
Blackburn, commanding another company, was frequently
on scouts with this gentleman and his company.
During the war a Lieutenant Davis of the
Terry Rangers, with eight of his men, were surrounded
in a house by Captain Blackburn, with his
company and this man’s company. They demanded
Davis’s surrender, which Davis refused and kept
them from the house all night, until their ammunition,
gave out. Davis was badly wounded, in the
nature of a broken ankle, unable to stand up, when
he agreed to surrender, Blackburn promising that
their lives should be spared and they should retain
their horses, provided they would leave Tennessee
at once, which Davis agreed to do and advised his
men to move out and turn over their arms. After
being disarmed, Blackburn had them led out into
the woods and shot down in cold blood; he, himself,
dragging Davis out to the gate post, cursing him
and emptying the contents of his pistol into his
head. Now this man, the guest of General Anderson,
was present with his company, and Dewitt was
anxious to apprise me of his great friendship to his
father, during the war. When the Federals entered
Lebanon the first time, General Anderson had some
very fine horses and about eight thousand dollars in
gold, with which he fled to the mountains near
Middleton and made this man’s house his home, being
old friends and acquaintances. While staying
there a short time, this man came to him one day
and told him that he felt that he could not stay at
home longer, that he was a Union man in principle
and, on account of it, was ostracised by some of the
neighboring families and said he had decided to go
and join Stokes’ cavalry, but his joining the Federal
Army should make no difference with General Anderson,
that he wanted him to continue making his
house his home, assuring him that he would be as
safe, although he had joined the Federal Army, to
stay there, as though he had joined the Confederate
Army. Knowing the man as he did, General Anderson
had no hesitancy in accepting his generous offer,
but remained there for several months with his fine
horses and eight thousand dollars in gold, and this
man never betrayed him. This was the man, then,
that was a visitor at General Anderson’s, with his
horse at the gate, of whose character Dewitt was
anxious to have me acquainted, satisfied if he learned
that I belonged to the Texas Rangers, he would
refer to the Davis murder.</p>

<p>I entered the house and was introduced to him
by General Anderson as Mr. Graber, formerly of
the Texas Rangers. At the table this gentleman
brought up the case of Lieutenant Davis and his
man, and denounced it as a brutal murder, saying
that he did his best to keep Blackburn from executing
them, begged and plead for their lives, but
to no purpose; he was second in command and
could do nothing.</p>

<p>It seems strange that I should have met with
a man who was present at the murder of Davis and
his companions, which happened when I was a
prisoner at Fort Delaware. Had any of Blackburn’s
men been caught by any members of our command,
they would certainly have been given a like treatment.</p>

<p>After spending a week with General Anderson
and his son, Dewitt, at their ranch, I returned
to town and had a conference with my several
friends, deciding it would be prudent to leave there
and go to Hickman, Kentucky, where Captain Britton
had a cousin, a prominent attorney of the place,
by the name of James Lauderdale, to whom he gave
me a letter of introduction and told me not to hesitate
to make a confidant of him and he would, no
doubt, have influence to get me into some kind of
business. Hickman, and a section of country tributary,
were considered somewhat prosperous, at that
time, and Hickman was doing a fair business. Being
right on the Mississippi River it was a shipping
point for considerable territory.</p>

<p>On my arrival, I presented my letter of introduction,
in the name of J. D. Roberts. He received me
very kindly and made me make his house my home
until I could get into business. Here I found only
his wife and his old father, who were exceedingly
kind to me. He soon told me of a young lawyer,
who used to be a member of our regiment, by the
name of Theo O. Goalder, who resided there and
practiced law. I immediately called on him at his
office and asked him to assist Major Lauderdale
to get me into some kind of business position. He
said he had a young friend by the name of John
Murphy, who was clerking for a Mr. Bailey in a
grocery store. He said that Murphy was getting
$50.00 per month and didn’t need the position, as
he was well fixed, and was satisfied that he could
induce him to resign in my favor and he could, no
doubt, make it satisfactory with Mr. Bailey. We
called upon Mr. Murphy, to whom I was introduced
as Mr. Roberts, and also to Mr. Bailey, and after stating
to him and Mr. Bailey that I had been a Confederate
soldier and was out of business, seeking
work, said I would very much appreciate the position,
which was readily tendered me, through Goalder’s
influence. I immediately went to work at this
place, on a salary of $50.00 per month, and board,
which was furnished me at the Bailey home, and a
room in the store.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>I Save the Life of an Enemy</span></h2></div>

<p>After probably six weeks or nearly two months,
getting acquainted with nearly all the county officials
and leading citizens of the town, I found it a
most charming community, and with few exceptions,
Southern in sentiment. One day Goalder came to
me, stating that there was a position open in a large
dry goods establishment, the firm of Amberg &amp; Company,
two Jew brothers. The oldest one seemed to
be quite a gentleman, but the younger, a black
Radical, so stated by Goalder. We immediately
went and applied for the position and when asked
the question if I knew anything about dry goods,
was able to state that I knew more about that business
than I did about groceries and was satisfied that
I could meet their every demand, referring them to
Major Lauderdale. Goalder was present and made
his own statement, vouching for my integrity and
ability. They immediately employed me at a salary
of $100.00 per month and I soon ingratiated myself
in their favor by close attention and ability to do
business, proving, as they expressed themselves to
Lauderdale, the best man they ever had.</p>

<p>After working two or three weeks, getting well
acquainted with their customers, especially those in
the town, Mr. Roberts became the talk of the town,
especially the lady customers, and was favored with
many invitations to dinners and entertainments,
which were always declined by me, as I was unable
to feel at home and enjoy other company. I spent
my time, principally, in my room, talking with
Goalder and others, whose acquaintance I had formed
and when they left, re-reading letters from home,
of which I had a considerable batch and which I
always carried in the inside pocket of my coat.</p>

<p>It seems my reserve and refusal to attend functions
created a little suspicion, particularly so in
the mind of young Amberg. One day, after about
three weeks’ service, while I was at work straightening
out some drawers containing silk goods, I had
pulled off my coat, the day being warm, and laid it
on a stack of domestic on the outside of the counter.
Young Amberg slipped to my coat, took out my letters,
the discovery of which I made when I went to
the coat. Here was a dilemma. I decided the best
thing to do was not to say anything about it, appear
as though I did not know the letters were missing
and allow him to take his time to read them. I went
over to the warehouse to do some work, stayed about
an hour, which gave him ample time to read the letters,
then returned for my coat and found the letters
replaced. After closing that night, I was called
into the office and found both of the Ambergs present.
They told me that business had got somewhat
dull, they were paying me a large salary,
and they must save this expense and requested
me to quit, saying they would cheerfully pay me
a month’s salary, if I quit at once. I told them
it was all right. When they paid me my salary
we parted.</p>

<p>Here now my cherished hope to prepare a home
for my family and begin life anew again, had vanished
and, in a moment of desperation, I decided
to go back to Texas and bring my family out from
among them.</p>

<p>During my absence my wife, soon after I parted
with her, had made a visit to Centerville, Leon
County, to a Dr. McLendon and his family, who
were old Alabama friends, and while there they
made up a music class for her and she continued
to live there. With the object of immediately returning
to Texas, I went around in Hickman and
bade adieu to all of my kind friends and acquaintances,
a few of whom were acquainted with my
condition and tried to persuade me against incurring
such great risks but, as stated, I felt desperate and
had decided unless I could get my family out from
among them and be with them, I did not care to live
any longer.</p>

<p>I took passage on the first boat for New Orleans
and paid my fare to the mouth of Red River, where
I expected to meet a boat for Shreveport.</p>

<p>On arrival at Memphis, Tennessee, the boat laid
over for several hours, delivering freight, during
which time I hunted up General Forrest, who was
then in the commission business. The General soon
recognized me and after telling him my trouble, requested
him to look out for a situation for me, under
an assumed name, while I went to Texas after my
family, which he cheerfully agreed to do.</p>

<p>While awaiting the Red River boat, a lieutenant
who was the Bureau Agent of a nearby parish arrived,
also awaiting a Mississippi boat for New Orleans.
A few hours afterward an upper boat
arrived to deliver some freight for Red River. The
lieutenant, being very fond of ardent spirits, and
there being no bar on the wharfboat, immediately
went over to the Mississippi boat where he imbibed
a few drinks. After delivering the freight the boat
rang a bell to depart and the lieutenant ran down
to the lower deck to get back to our wharfboat. The
Mississippi boat already having cast off its bow line,
was moving slowly apart from the wharfboat when
the lieutenant attempted to step across, and, losing
his headway, he became balanced between the two
boats—with the boats moving apart. Discovering
his predicament, I jumped over to where he stood
and offered him my hand and pulled him over, thereby,
no doubt, saving his life. If he had lost his footing
he would have dropped in and pulled me in with
him and both would have drowned as there is a
strong underflow at this point and nothing which
falls in ever comes to the surface. I did this under
the impulse of the moment, at the risk of my own
life, and saved the life of a man who, had he known
who I was, no doubt would have been instrumental
in having me captured.</p>

<p>On arrival at the mouth of the Red River, where
with some other passengers, we had to await a
Shreveport boat from New Orleans, I met a Mr.
Black from Leon County, who had been over to Alabama
after his brother’s family, moving them to
Texas and was expecting a couple of mule teams at
Grand Ecore, to haul them to Leon County. I confided
my secret to Black, who knew all about our
case and insisted on my going with him on his
wagons, which I decided to do. At Grand Ecore we
met his wagons, which were so heavily laden with
household goods and the family of his brother, three
or four little children, that I preferred to walk behind
the wagon, holding on to the same, to keep up
with them.</p>

<p>We traveled the old San Antonio road in order
to find good crossings at the different rivers and
when we reached Alto, Cherokee County, I took
stage for Rusk, where I had an old army friend,
Judge Sam A. Wilson, the only man I knew in the
place.</p>

<p>On arrival at Rusk, meeting with my friend, Wilson,
who was much surprised to see me and particularly
to learn of my troubles, I requested him to get
me the best horse that he could find about the place,
one that would do to ride in among the enemy.
After studying a while he said that he did not know
of a good saddle horse in the place, but thought
that we could be accommodated at the livery stable,
where I was furnished what turned out to be an old
plug. I parted with my friend Wilson, he never
expecting to see me again, and started for Centerville,
Leon County, assuming the name of R. F.
Jones.</p>

<p>Arriving within four or five miles of Centerville
about noon, I decided to stop at a house and go into
the town at night. For this purpose, I called for
dinner and told the landlord I was looking around
for a location in Texas, that I was from North Carolina
and from what I had seen of Texas, was favorably
impressed with it. After dinner, discussing
several localities I had passed through, he asked
how I liked his place. I told him I thought he had
a good place. He then offered to sell to me and
also a tanyard he had on sale; although I had never
seen a tanyard, I looked it all over carefully and
his entire place, leaving the impression with him
that I meant business and consumed the balance of
the evening in that way. After supper I told him I
believed that I would go on to Centerville and stay
all night and that I might be back again and try to
drive a bargain for his place, unless I found something
that suited me better. By way of excuse, my
leaving so late, I told him I had heard of a particular
friend, who had lately moved to Centerville, with
whom I wanted to spend the night.</p>

<p>I now started for Centerville, where I arrived
about nine o’clock at night. The night was very
dark and I stopped to inquire where Dr. McLendon
lived, expecting to find my wife at his house. At
Dr. McLendon’s home I was informed that he was
at a doctor’s office up in town, and directions given
where I could find him. I concluded best to see
him first before asking for my wife at the house.</p>

<p>On entering the doctor’s room I found four gentlemen
talking, but did not know Dr. McLendon,
having never seen him before, nor had he ever seen
me. I asked for Dr. McLendon; he spoke and said
he was the man. I then told him that I was camped
on a certain creek, some several miles from town,
and had a very sick child, that I wanted him to go
and see at once. He said all right and started out
of the room with me. When we got to the gate he
said, “You will have to go with me up to the house,
for my horse.” I told him all right and walked
by the side of him, leading my horse by the bridle.
He soon asked me, “What seems to be the matter
with your child, sir?” I answered, “Nothing, I
hope, Doctor. I haven’t seen my child in ten months
and have come after it and my wife; tell me where
I can find them. My name is Graber.” He jumped
like he was shot and said, “For God’s sake get on
that horse and leave here quick. You are certainly
not up with the excitement.” “Well,” said I, “if
there is any extraordinary excitement here, I am
not.” He said, “Your family are not in town tonight;
they are about seventeen miles from here, on
a visit to her sister, who is at Dr. Baldwin’s. They
are visiting there, refugees from yellow fever.” He
says, “Let’s get out in the brush where nobody will
see us and we will talk matters over.” We then
walked to the edge of the town and sat down on
the ground in the brush, out of hearing, when he
detailed the situation, saying that Tom Thorn, my
partner, had been ranging around there for two or
three weeks, annoying Capt. Bradford, in command
of the garrison, which was camped near town. Tom
had registered at the hotel, “T. J. Thorn and friend,”
taking a meal there. Then, one night at roll call,
he and his friend had fired into the camp and finally
he had sent Captain Bradford a challenge, that he
would fight him and any ten of his men at any time
and place he might designate and signed the challenge
“Thos. J. Thorn and friend.”</p>

<p>Captain Bradford naturally concluded that this
“friend” was Graber and knowing his and his
family’s friendship for my wife, concluded that Dr.
McLendon knew Graber’s whereabouts and showed
him a big roll of money that morning, claiming it
was four thousand dollars, saying, “Dr. McLendon,
here is a reward offered for Thorn and Graber. You
know where Graber is; here is your money.” Dr.
McLendon was a practicing surgeon for these troops,
as they had no regular army surgeon. I told Dr.
McLendon I had come after my wife and baby and
intended to take them out or die in the attempt,
even if the whole Federal army of Texas was there
to guard them. He furthermore stated that Captain
Bradford had issued an order to the sheriff of the
county to arrest Thorn and Graber by the next
Monday morning, or be removed from office as an
impediment to reconstruction.</p>

<p>I now had Dr. McLendon to give me directions
to reach the place where my wife was visiting, which
he did, however saying that it would be impossible
for me to find the way there, on account of the darkness
of the night. Nevertheless I started out and
soon got lost, and when I finally gave up the effort,
I found myself only three-quarters of a mile from
town. I was tired, suffering with a great headache
and called at a house, where I was permitted to stay
for the night and, after breakfast next morning, getting
fresh directions to Dr. Baldwin’s house, where
my wife’s sister was stopping, I immediately proceeded
there.</p>

<p>After discussing the situation with my friends,
as well as my wife, we decided best to have them
get up a hack and a confidential driver, by the next
morning, which they succeeded in doing and we
started on the main road, leading into the San Antonio
road, following that every day, stopping at
houses at night and finally reached Rusk, Cherokee
County, without an accident or any trouble. Judge
Wilson was again surprised at my success in bringing
my family out, as he never had expected to see
me again. I then told him, “Now, for a good stopping
place,” and after considering all families in
the town, where we might get board and none having
any extra room, said, “The only place I know of,
that has room is at my old daddy-in-law’s, Judge
M. D. Priest, who is the meanest old Radical in the
State of Texas, but he has a most excellent family,
who will do all they can for your wife and child and
make you feel at home. We will make a confidant of
him and he will never betray you.” I said, “Judge,
you know what you are doing; anything you say
will be satisfactory to me.” We then proceeded to
Judge Priest’s house, where I was introduced in
the name of Jones and was kindly received and
made to feel at home. Really we could not have
found a more desirable place. We had excellent
rooms and good board, just on the outskirts of the
town. Rusk, at that time, was a very small place,
about three or four hundred inhabitants, but it was
the county seat of Cherokee County. We sent back
our driver with his hack and team and he never
betrayed us.</p>

<br/>
<span class='sc'>I Get Back Into the Business World.</span></h2></div>

<p>During the first month of our stay there, I visited
the business part of town occasionally and made
a few purchases at the house of Boyd, Frazer &amp;
Parks, a firm composed of John A. Boyd, who
thought he was a merchant; Dr. Frazer, a practicing
physician, who tried to be the bookkeeper, and M.
M. Parks, who was a farmer, living out in the country,
who furnished the money for the business. Boyd
knew nothing about keeping or showing off his
stock. In appearance it was one of the most conglomerated
mixtures of merchandise I ever saw, but
they were very popular men, particularly with the
farmers in the country, and did a large business, considering
their limited territory.</p>

<p>I soon got tired of lying around, doing nothing,
but I felt that Rusk was about the safest place I
could find anywhere, as the entire community, in
sentiment, were true to the Lost Cause, with only
one doubtful character, which was Judge M. D.
Priest and he was really not a bad man at heart.
When we confided my secret to him, telling him my
life was in his hands, he appreciated fully the confidence
reposed and declared that he never would
betray us, which promise he fully kept and of which
he afterwards expressed himself as being very proud.</p>

<p>Happening in to Boyd, Frazer &amp; Parks one day,
disgusted with the appearance of his stock of goods
as kept, although it was none of my business, I concluded
this would be a good place to get acquainted,
on my knowledge of the business. I proposed to Mr.
Boyd, who was the active member, running the business,
that with his permission I would rearrange and
straighten out his stock, without charge, as I had
to remain over for a few weeks, had nothing to do
and thought I could improve the appearance of
things considerably. He readily consented, so I pulled
off my coat and went to work, which proved a
great treat to me. In a few days I had made such a
change in the appearance of the stock, that customers
seemed surprised and asked, “John A., have
you been getting in a new stock of goods?” About
the third evening, the partners got together, had a
consultation and I was asked if I was able to keep
books. I told them that I had kept books for a very
large business in Southern Texas before the war,
when they made me a proposition to go to work for
them, keep their books and attend the sales department
on a salary of $75.00 per month, which I accepted
and soon felt here was the place to keep hid
out from the powers that were, as there was no military
nearer than Tyler, Jefferson and Shreveport
and no one knew of my secret, except Judge Wilson
and Judge Priest, whose families were not made acquainted
with it.</p>

<p>After considerable time, spent pleasantly at the
home of Judge Priest, we decided to move into town
for better convenience on account of its being nearer
my business. We rented an humble home and
went to housekeeping. I soon had an extensive
acquaintance through the county, but always in the
name of Jones, yet gradually imparting my secret
to the most reliable friends I made in the town,
notably the Bonner brothers, Judge R. H. Guinn,
Judge James E. Dillard and others. After nearly
a year in the service of Boyd, Frazer &amp; Parks, I met
an old gentleman by the name of T. L. Philleo, who
had done an extensive business in general merchandise
before the war. Mr. Philleo had a fine storehouse
on the north side of the square, empty, except
as to some castings, and had owing him perhaps
as much as fifty thousand dollars in notes and
accounts, acquired before the war. He was unable
to collect much of it and conceived the idea that to
make a success of this collecting, he ought to go into
business again, which he was unable to do, on account
of his age. I having established a reputation
of being the best merchant in the town, Philleo made
a proposition to me to go into copartnership with
him. While he had no money he had a most excellent
credit in New Orleans and suggested that I
could go down there and buy for his account such
stock as I needed to enable us to enter into competition
with the balance of the town. Canvassing the
subject thoroughly, I decided that I could make
more money with my half interest in the profits of
the concern, than to work on salary. He was willing
and anxious to give me the full management
and control of the business. Considering my condition
then, I decided best to accept, which I did, and
soon proceeded to New Orleans, armed with a letter
in the name of R. F. Jones, to Speak &amp; Buckner,
his old commission merchants, and other leading
houses in the different lines of merchandise that we
had to buy.</p>

<p>Arriving at New Orleans, I put up at the Southern
Hotel, then the headquarters of nearly all
Texas merchants, within one block of the custom
house, where General Sheridan had his headquarters,
and went to work, buying a general stock of merchandise
for account of T. L. Philleo &amp; Company;
“R. F. Jones being the company,” so Capt. Buckner
stated in introducing me. Speak &amp; Buckner also
accepted several thousand dollars on cash purchases,
such as groceries and staple hardware, nails, etc.,
for which he asked us to send him cotton in the fall.
I now returned home with my purchases and began
to feel that I had a new life before me and some
prospect of making a good living.</p>

<p>I arranged my stock very attractively, for which
the house was well suited, though I had some trouble
inducing farmers to come over on my side of
the square. It was the only business house over
there, the center of business being located on the
east and south side. By close application and hard
work I gradually succeeded in building up a fair
business.</p>

<p>After some months, I found the unpleasant condition
of Mr. Philleo’s state of mind, worrying over
his old matters and trying to collect, which seemed
a complete failure, seemed to bear heavily on his
mind and I noticed it was giving way under the
pressure. He had a most excellent family, wife and
two daughters, who had been raised in wealth and
affluence and were somewhat extravagantly inclined,
and the thought of perhaps losing all of his outstanding
accounts and old age creeping on him very
fast, made him very despondent and unhappy. He
would go to the store every night after supper,
open his safe, take out all of his notes and accounts,
scatter them around on his table and a double bed,
used by a young man clerk in the store, who reported
his actions to me, and would study and look
at them, occupying hours, sometimes until one
o’clock at night, then replace them in the safe. Many
of the makers of the notes and accounts had been
killed or died during the war and their estates were
not able to pay anything. I was satisfied if this
condition continued his mind would finally break
down and it kept me in a state of uneasiness. I,
therefore concluded that I would wind up this first
year’s business and quit, which I finally did, after
settling up all bills and the entire business, satisfactorily
to all concerned. The year’s business showed
us each a net profit of about eighteen hundred
dollars; outside of this I had demonstrated the fact
that I was able to do a nice, clean business, safely.</p>

<p>Just as I feared, poor Mr. Philleo, some two or
three years after, committed suicide in the back
room of his store, at night, with his notes and papers
laying all around him, stabbing himself with
his pocketknife through the heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Philleo was one of the most kind-hearted,
benevolent and charitable of men, and was known
as such all over the country and he left many friends,
but his family was poorly provided for.</p>

<p>After winding up the business of T. L. Philleo &amp;
Company, I was offered a position with R. B. Martin,
an old merchant of the place, who at one time had
done a large business. His stock had been run down
for the want of means to keep it up, the result of
poor management. Martin had a wealthy brother
at Shreveport, of the firm of Gregg &amp; Martin, cotton
commission merchants. They had agreed to back
him for ten thousand dollars, so he represented to
me, with which he expected to buy a fifteen thousand
dollar new stock in New Orleans. Martin agreed to
pay me a hundred dollars a month to begin with and
increase my salary as business justified it. I then
proceeded to New Orleans, to buy this stock of
goods, stopping over at Shreveport to obtain letters
from Gregg &amp; Martin, authorizing me to draw on
them for ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. Dave Martin denied having promised his
brother this acceptance, but told me to go on to New
Orleans, that Bob’s credit was good and he could
buy all the goods he wanted, without their acceptance.
I then proceeded to New Orleans. Calling on
his old houses, I found he was owing a great deal
of money and having promised through traveling
men, who had called on him, that he would furnish
Gregg &amp; Martin’s acceptance for ten thousand dollars
and then not being able to do so, his credit was
so greatly impaired that they refused to sell him
any more goods. I then wired Dave Martin again
for authority to draw, reporting that Bob was unable
to buy goods without his backing. I laid over,
awaiting an answer, several days, and in the meantime,
called on Speak &amp; Buckner, who were glad to
see me. I told them of the failure of my trip, unless
I heard favorably from Gregg &amp; Martin.</p>

<p>In the course of conversation, Captain Buckner
said, “Jones, you’ve got no business working on
salary; why don’t you go into business for yourself?”
I said, “Captain Buckner, that is simply out
of the question. I have neither name nor money.”
He said, “Go and ascertain how much money you
will need to buy such stock as you would be willing
to start with.” Already acquainted with the custom
on terms, I stated that with five thousand dollars
in cash I could buy a fifteen-thousand-dollar stock
of goods, on four and six months. Captain Buckner
said, “Go ahead, and get to work buying and draw
on us for five thousand dollars on the same arrangement
that I had with T. L. Philleo &amp; Company.”
That was to send him cotton next fall. I said,
“Captain Buckner, you don’t know who you are
talking to, as I have told you I have neither name
nor money and you cannot afford to take this risk.”
He says, “You go and do what I tell you; I know all
about you and don’t want to know anything more.”
This gave me to understand that he was acquainted
with my trouble and that I was under an assumed
name and not having any other prospects of business
in Rusk (which I could not afford to leave on account
of the great security this place offered), I decided
to accept and told Buckner that I would do business
in the name of S. A. Wilson &amp; Company, S. A.
Wilson, being a lawyer and a great friend of mine.
He was well known and a man of great influence.
Buckner said to arrange that to suit myself. He
was already slightly acquainted with Wilson and
well posted on his character as a man. I immediately
went to work, buying goods for a stock of general
merchandise, which consumed about a week, and
when ready to close up matters, Captain Buckner
suggested that instead of drawing drafts on them,
he give me the money to pay cash, in order to lead
the merchants to think that I was paying my own
money, thereby establishing a better credit. This
was done.</p>

<p>Winding up my affairs in New Orleans, I took
the first boat for Shreveport, with my stock of goods
aboard, and arrived in Rusk in due time, followed by
the stock. When I communicated my actions to
Judge Wilson, he seemed greatly surprised, but
stated it was perfectly satisfactory. I was at liberty
to use him he said, whenever it was necessary.
The best storehouse in the place, though isolated
from the center of business, was vacant, and I rented
this at a nominal figure. When the goods arrived
I soon had it the most attractive place in the town.</p>

<p>Bob Martin, of course, was disappointed and
made me the scapegoat of his disappointment, blaming
me for not buying his stock of goods. I gradually
built up a desirable business; went to New Orleans
twice a year and bought goods under the very
shadow of Sheridan’s headquarters.</p>

<p>When, after several years, the infamous reconstruction
era was terminated, the military withdrawn
and civil government restored, though in the
hands of negroes and Radicals, I decided to assume
my identity and proceeded to New Orleans to settle
up my bills.</p>

<p>After doing so, I would tell the managers, from
this time on, the firm is no longer S. A. Wilson &amp;
Company, but simply H. W. Graber. “Why, Mr.
Jones, have you sold out?” “No, sir; I have not
sold out, but simply correcting a fictitious name.”
“Well, who is H. W. Graber?” “This is the man,”
which of course created surprise and when asked for
explanation, would tell them that I had been forced
to hide out for nearly four years, to keep General
Sheridan from having me shot down, which he had
ordered his Texas garrisons to do, without the benefit
of a court martial, therefore I was forced to resort
to hiding my identity. I then suggested, as these
people were all Northern houses, that, “You don’t
want to sell me any more goods?” when they said,
“Mr. Graber, go ahead and buy all the goods you
want; your credit is not the least impaired; a man
that can pass through such an ordeal, as you have
done, unscathed, is entitled to more credit than he
needs.”</p>

<p>While, of course, this created a sensation in New
Orleans business circles, the most astonished man of
them all was Captain R. T. Buckner, who, it seems,
didn’t know as much as he thought he did, when he
handed me his money.</p>

<p>Soon after my arrival at Rusk, I was made a
Mason and also joined the Odd Fellows Lodge. I
joined these institutions in my own name, satisfied
that my secret would be safe with the membership.
During a great revival of the union of all churches,
wife and I joined the Presbyterian Church and I
was ordained a deacon in the church, in due time.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>I Assist in Establishing the Masonic Institute.</span></h2></div>

<p>In conjunction with some members of the Masonic
Lodge, we conceived the idea of creating a
Masonic Institute, a school of high grade, which was
very much needed. I was appointed chairman of
the building committee. I went to work actively, in
conjunction with the committee, and raised means
by private subscription, which enabled us to go to
work, building at once. When trustees were elected
I was made a member of the Board of Trustees and
on the organization of the faculty, we elected a
Scotchman, one Professor John Joss, believing that
he would prove a good disciplinarian. He had a
great reputation as a teacher. There were some bad
boys in the community and in the language of Judge
Guinn, who was a member of the board, “We needed
somebody to use the rod to straighten out these
bad characters.” In this, however, we were mistaken;
Professor Joss did not use the rod, but only
kindness, commanding the respect of the entire
school, including these bad boys, on account of his
great knowledge and manner of imparting instruction.
He was a most popular teacher, beloved by
all who came in contact with him, and he built up a
large and popular school, which turned out such
men as Governor Hogg and Governor Campbell and
no less than a dozen eminent lawyers and physicians
known all over the State. I regret to have to report
that, in the course of four or five years, on account
of delicate health, Joss was forced to give up the
school and move to Galveston, where he died.</p>

<p>The town of Rusk, being left out by the International
&amp; Great Northern Railroad, caused us to haul
freight fifteen miles, over mountains and bad roads.
I began to plan railroad connection for the town and
conceived the idea of building a tap road, though
unfamiliar with railroad business and especially the
cost of a road.</p>

<p>In accordance with my plans, I called a meeting
of the business men, submitting the same, which was
to build a narrow gauge road from Jacksonville to
Rusk, getting a charter with a State land donation of
sixteen sections to the mile, which policy had been
adopted by the State to encourage the building of
railroads. In accordance therewith, we instructed
Judge James E. Dillard, who was our Senator from
that district, then attending the Legislature in session,
to procure the necessary legislation and had
him draw up a charter for the Rusk tap road. The
bill covering the same he immediately introduced.
I told my Rusk friends that with the aid of sixteen
sections to the mile, and a further bonus of twenty-five
thousand dollars in cash, which we believed
could be raised in the town, we could induce Ward,
Dewey &amp; Company, lessees of the penitentiary, to
accept these assets and build the road, as they had
several thousand convicts to feed and had no use
for them.</p>

<p>While these matters were pending and the International
Railroad had been extended to Rockdale, I
concluded to visit Rockdale, prospecting for a new
business location.</p>

<p>On this trip to Rockdale, I met Ira M. Evans, the
Secretary of the International Railroad Company,
and submitted my plan of building a tap road, suggesting
that perhaps his company might be induced
to take hold of it, for the subsidy of the State land
donation and the twenty-five thousand dollars in
cash. He laughed at the idea, saying that they
could not afford to run the road for its earnings, if
we were able to build a first-class connection. He
said our community would not be able to raise one-tenth
of its cost and soon convinced me that it would
be cheaper to move the whole town of Rusk to Jacksonville,
than it would be to build a first-class road.
I then submitted that, if we were unable to build
a railroad, why not build a tramway, which would
be within the bounds of our means and a vast improvement
on the wagon road. He readily fell
into my scheme, suggested that it was feasible, even
with wooden rails, and that we had plenty of
pine timber, the heart of which could be bought
cheap and would make good, durable rails, amply
strong, provided we would place ties eighteen or
twenty inches apart.</p>

<p>I now asked him, he being a practical railroad
man, to submit a specification on the grade, ties and
rails, which he was pleased to do, and suggested that
we change the charter we had had introduced, to
that of the Rusk Tramway.</p>

<p>Immediately on my return to Rusk, I called a
meeting of the business men and leading citizens
and submitted the plan for the Rusk Tramway, having
no difficulty in convincing them that we were
unable to build a railroad. A committee, appointed
by the meeting, was instructed to communicate to
Senator Dillard our desire to change the charter to
that of the Rusk Tramway, which he did, and included
a clause granting eight sections to the mile.</p>

<p>After having established my business and a good
credit in commercial circles, I decided that in mercantile
pursuits I was too much circumscribed on account
of existing conditions.</p>

<p>The bottom lands in Cherokee County were then
the only productive lands for cotton and, as the uplands
were light and largely worn out, and as I had
a good knowledge of the prairie country around
Waxahachie, where I had spent several years of my
boyhood, I decided that this would be a better section
of the State to build up in, and arranged my
matters to make this move within the next twelve
months.</p>

<p>When the charter for the tramway was returned,
they proceeded to organize and elected a Rev. Davis,
a very influential and good business man of the
community, president of the company, after my having
refused the same, on the ground that I did not
feel permanently located, expecting to make a move
to Waxahachie as soon as possible. Rev. Davis
proved a valuable man for the position and immediately
went to work canvassing the territory tributary
to Rusk, for the sale of stock, which he succeeded
in doing, to a limited extent and, by my advice,
they commenced negotiations with Ward,
Dewey &amp; Company, lessees of the penitentiary, for
the construction of the road. As heretofore stated,
these people had a large force of convicts which
they had to feed, and no work for them. The country
subscriptions, which Rev. Davis secured, were
paid in provisions and forage by the farmers, which
enabled the company to feed the convicts while at
work. After a time, I arranged to move to Waxahachie
and soon after I left Rusk. Ward, Dewey &amp;
Company went to work on the construction of the
road and before its completion it was decided to
use a little four-ton Porter-Allen locomotive, in place
of mules.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention, after submitting my plan
for a railroad, Judge Dillard came home on a visit
to his sick wife and while spending a few days at
Rusk, had a meeting of the business men, which numbered
only seven or eight, in Captain Barron’s office.
He submitted that the Legislature had decided to
branch the penitentiary in Eastern Texas in the
iron region, which was supposed to be near Jefferson,
at Kellyville; a Mr. Kelly having demonstrated
the existence of good iron ore in that section, manufacturing
plows, andirons, chimney backs, etc., the
same as Mr. Philleo had done in Cherokee County,
but Dillard said, “Now, if you all want the penitentiary
located here, I believe I can secure it for
you.”</p>

<p>One after another of these gentlemen got up and
stated their serious objections, saying they had one
of the best and most moral communities in the State
of Texas and would not give up their school prospect
for the penitentiary. I suggested to them, saying,
“You know I am making my arrangements to leave
here, because I do not see any prospect for future
growth of the place, but, gentlemen, now is your
time; you have been talking unlimited iron in the
ground, of the highest quality, but it will have to
be demonstrated to private capital that it is here
in unlimited amount and high quality before you
can ever hope to induce private capital to expend
the amount necessary for such demonstration. There
is no question in my mind that this iron, if you are
correct in your claims as to its quality and amount,
will prove the greatest resource of wealth, far greater
than your farming interests. Locate the penitentiary
here; the State will be forced to develop it
and immediately build you a railroad connection to
Jacksonville.” After a full and fair investigation
by this meeting they became enthusiastic and instructed
Dillard to go for it.</p>

<p>To secure the location of Rusk for the penitentiary,
it was necessary to canvass its advantages with
the Legislature and especially take charge of a
committee appointed by the Legislature to select a
location, which required a great deal of time and
ability, and, with the assistance and influence of
friends of Dillard, who was one of the most popular
men in the State Senate, they finally succeeded in
landing the decision of the Legislature to build their
branch penitentiary at Rusk.</p>

<p>On the withdrawal of the Federal troops and the
dissolution of the Freedmen’s Bureau, E. J. Davis
was appointed Temporary Governor of Texas, until
an election could be had for his successor. The election
was held in due time, resulting in a Radical
Republican Legislature, composed of some of the
meanest men in the State and a few negroes, with
E. J. Davis elected his own successor and the solid
white element of the State disfranchised. They took
charge and commenced an era of plunder. I do not
believe there were more than a half dozen good men,
including Judge Dillard and Professor J. R. Cole,
members of this Legislature, but these did everything
they could with the risk of being assassinated,
to stem the drift of plunder.</p>

<p>Davis soon organized a State Militia and a State
Police Force, stationing them in populous negro districts,
formerly occupied by United States troops
and Freedmen’s Bureau, all under the leadership
of Adjutant-General Davidson, who was as unscrupulous
a character on graft as any man ever in
public office. He arrested leading citizens in different
sections of the State, without charges being
preferred against them, as they had not committed
any unlawful acts, and demanded large sums of
money as ransoms. One case was notable—that of a
wealthy farmer near Hillsboro, a Mr. Gathwright,
whom he made pay ten thousand dollars for his
release.</p>

<p>We had stationed at Rusk a lieutenant-sheriff,
with his police, who was a great friend of Judge
Priest and whose daughter he courted and finally
married.</p>

<p>A Captain McAnally, who commanded a Confederate
Scout in Texas during the war and had
proven a gallant soldier in the army, was appointed
by Davis, captain of police, and his acceptance
urged by his friends, thinking it would be for the
best interests to have him command a company of
police, than any of the Radical gang. He was finally
induced to accept the appointment. His home was
at Brenham. He was instructed by the Governor to
proceed to Huntsville and await the orders of the
District Court, presided over by the infamous Judge
Burnett. While court was in session, three young
men were arrested by McAnally for whipping a
few insolent negroes who had insulted some young
ladies on the street returning home from a shopping
tour. These young men were taken before Judge
Burnett, with arms concealed about their person.
The judge called McAnally up to his bench and
whispered his order to him, “Take these men to the
penitentiary, but be careful, I suspect they are armed,
and hold up the execution of this order until I
can get to my hotel.” Soon after the judge left
his bench for the hotel, McAnally demanded of
these young men to throw up their hands, when they
immediately drew their six-shooters and commenced
shooting at him and his gang of police, shooting
their way out of the courthouse, wounding McAnally
in the arm and he dropped between some
benches, pretending he was dead. This was, no
doubt, what saved him. Judge Burnett had not
quite reached his hotel when he heard the guns fire,
broke into a run and crawled under the hotel. These
young men, after shooting their way out, mounted
horses and started north for the Indian Territory,
by way of Rusk and Paris, with McAnally and his
police in close pursuit.</p>

<p>Arriving at Rusk he commanded Lieutenant
Sheriff and party to join him in this pursuit, which
they did. On parting, on this trip, with his sweetheart,
Miss Lou Priest, Sheriff told her where he was going
with McAnally and on their return, they were
going to arrest Mr. Graber. The whole Priest family
being good friends of ours and Miss Lou’s sister,
the wife of my friend, Judge Wilson, she immediately
went over to Judge Wilson’s and imparted
this information about my contemplated arrest.
Judge Wilson came over to town and had a meeting
of a few of the leading lawyers of the place, notably
the Bonners, Judge R. H. Guinn and Judge J. E.
Dillard, who after canvassing the matter, decided
that the object of my arrest was altogether political.
They were expecting to make great capital out of
it for the necessity of continuing their Radical
regime. Satisfied that they might manufacture evidence
to convict me in a Radical court, these friends
advised that I had better go into exile again, thereby
probably saving my life. I told them to tell me
what to do in order to stay, for I had done all the
running I ever expected to do. I was satisfied this
police had no legal authority for my arrest, as I
had never violated any civil law and I could not
afford, in justice to my family, my friends and my
creditors, to again have my business wrecked.</p>

<p>When these friends found that I was determined
not to be arrested by this infamous police and in
order to be doubly sure, they advised me to go down
to Austin County and investigate the records and
know positively that this police had no authority
for my arrest.</p>

<p>On leaving for this trip, armed with a letter from
Colonel T. R. Bonner to Judge J. D. Giddings, whom
they suggested I call on for advice in the matter,
and leaving a message for Lieutenant Sheriff, that
I had gone on a trip for a week or ten days and
promptly on my return I would report to him, I
left for Austin County.</p>

<p>Passing through Anderson, I conferred with
Hannibal Boone, who suggested there was no necessity
for my going to Austin County, where he was
living at the time I had trouble with the soldiers.
He said that there could be no case against me, as
I had violated no civil law and my dealings were altogether
with the military. Stopping at Brenham, in
my conference with Judge Giddings, he became very
much exercised on the threatened arrest of myself
and said, “Mr. Graber, go back home; resist their
arrest in the most effective manner. It is time we
were calling a halt on this infamous police system;
resist them, and the whole State of Texas will be
at your back.” I said, “Judge Giddings, I thank
you for the advice; it is exactly my feeling and determination
not to submit, peacefully, to this arrest.”</p>

<p>Being so close to the town of Bellville, I decided
to finish my trip, went there and called on Hunt &amp;
Holland, leading attorneys, who repeated Judge Giddings’
advice. I now returned home and immediately
sent word to Lieutenant Sheriff that I could
be seen at my place of business at any time he
wanted me.</p>

<p>I returned at night and next morning proceeded
up to my store, sent word to Mr. R. B. Reagan, a
brother of Judge John H. Reagan, a man of iron
nerve, the sheriff of the county, to come up to the
store at once. On reaching there I told him that
Lieutenant Sheriff, with his police, had threatened
to arrest me, that I had just returned from Austin
County and had investigated, finding that they had
no authority or warrant for my arrest and I claimed
his protection. He said, “Mr. Graber, load up your
shotguns in your stock, set them behind your door
and when they come to effect your arrest, open on
them and I and John and George, will be about.”
John Reagan was his deputy and a George Taylor,
another deputy, all men as fearless and resolute as
any set of men ever together, with nerve to fight a
hundred police. In about an hour I noticed Lieutenant
Sheriff coming up the south side of the
square, by himself, apparently unarmed. I met him
in my door, when he said, “Mr. Graber, Miss Lou
Priest told me that you had some very nice gentlemen’s
hats.” I told him I had; he told me he wanted
to look at some. I got down a box of hats from
the top shelf and allowed him to select his hat out
of the box, the size he needed, treating him indifferently.
He got out his number, put it on his head and
stepped up to a glass suspended on the shelf, passing
between the counters. Looking at the hat in
the glass he said, “I believe this becomes me pretty
well; what is it worth?” I told him, “Five dollars.”
When he turned around to walk from behind
the counter, he espied the shotguns behind
the door. I noticed it seemed to affect him a little
but he soon recovered, paid me the money and left
the store, saying, “A fine day today,” and this finally
settled my trouble. He evidently came there with
the intention of spying out the situation before
attempting my arrest. When he left the house he
noticed Sheriff Reagan with his deputies near.</p>

<p>This ended my trouble. I felt I had conquered
a peace which would be a lasting one, as far as
the military and our Radical Government were concerned.
This changed condition gave me a free hand
to engage in further enterprises and to rebuild my
own fortune, as well as to work toward the benefit
of the community in which I made my home.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>I Remove to Waxahachie and Go Into Business There.</span></h2></div>

<p>As heretofore stated, I had spent several years of
my boyhood in Waxahachie, during the fifties, and
became attached to its people because of their great
interest in me, on account of my being an orphan.
I felt ever grateful. Furthermore I recognized the
value of the rich lands of Ellis County and territory
tributary thereto, and I decided to make Waxahachie
my permanent home.</p>

<p>Arriving at Ennis, one of its shipping depots, I
took stage for Waxahachie, where I rented a storehouse
belonging to Judge McMillan, and employed
his son, N. A., as bookkeeper and salesman in the
house. The two-story building next to the Getzendaner
&amp; Ferris Bank, was the most modern store
building in the town and young Mr. McMillan, one
of the most popular and best posted men on the
Ellis County farmer, I could find, having been in
business with his father in this house for several
years, moving there from Alabama.</p>

<p>To give the reader a fair idea of the condition
existing, I found the old set of merchants, who were
doing business there before the war, still adhering
to old-time methods, selling goods on twelve months’
time and charging about twenty-five per cent more
for same than the towns of Ennis or Palmer, which
were selling altogether for cash. These towns were
doing a more lucrative business than Waxahachie.
Not a house in Waxahachie would buy a bale of
cotton for cash, thereby turning the cotton market
over to the towns of Ennis and Palmer. The stage
driver that carried me back to Ennis had money
sent by a lady at Waxahachie, to buy a dozen spools
of thread at Ennis, where spool thread was selling
at 75 cents a dozen and Waxahachie charging a dollar
a dozen.</p>

<p>This encouraged me in the belief that Waxahachie
was a good place to start in again, as I expected
to do business altogether for cash and buy
cotton for cash, as cotton always controlled business.</p>

<p>Having bought goods almost exclusively in New
Orleans, except a few purchases in St. Louis and Galveston,
I found that Galveston was about as good
market as the others and, on account of its nearness,
adopted a plan of buying goods often, in smaller
quantities and ordering them as they were needed,
which always gave me a fresh stock of goods and
proved very satisfactory.</p>

<p>While engaged in buying my first stock for
Waxahachie, at the house of P. J. Willis &amp; Brother
at Galveston, I met a Mr. Joe Farley, who was one
of the traveling credit men for the house, and was
also a partner in the house of Clift &amp; Farley of
Waxahachie. He came to me, saying that he understood
I was buying a stock for Waxahachie and
wanted to tell me that I could not find a more undesirable
place to begin a new business, as he had
decided to reduce prices materially, to a point that
would not leave any profit. I thanked him for the
information and especially for his resolution to reduce
prices, which I told him I intended to do, and
would much prefer his saving me the unpleasant
duty. Farley, however, never carried out his threat
until after I had started my business and forced
them to do so. I also forced them to buy cotton for
cash, thereby making Waxahachie a cotton market.</p>

<p>On my return to Rusk, I immediately packed
whatever stock of goods I had left and shipped to
Waxahachie, then moved my family over there and
went to housekeeping in a rented house. I next proceeded
to Galveston, where I arranged with Mr.
Willis to give me an open account of twelve or fifteen
thousand dollars, on which I made remittances
every week and continued to order goods almost
every week, which always gave me fresh stock and
proved very satisfactory to Willis, as well as myself,
and very attractive to the public.</p>

<p>I now commenced the purchase of cotton for
cash. I was a good judge of cotton classification,
and being very careful in keeping posted on the
course of the market, especially Galveston, and cotton
being in transit only a short time, I was enabled
to handle cotton without any great risk, besides I
made shipments altogether to Cannon &amp; Company.
Mr. Cannon, as heretofore stated, was an old friend
before the war, for whom I had kept books and
worked in his sales department at Hempstead. In
entering the cotton market and paying cash, the
old mossback business element of the town sat
around in front of their stores, smoking and whittling
goods boxes, making all manner of predictions
that that fellow wouldn’t last long—I would soon
get out of money and “bust.”</p>

<p>I bought cotton from farmers over about Bristol,
on the Trinity, on the other side of the Houston &amp;
Texas Central Railroad, paid them cash, and 75
cents a bale to haul it back to Ennis, then they
would turn around and spend the money with me
for goods and return home happy and contented.</p>

<p>About this time we had the Grangers, a strong
farmers’ organization, who had decided to concentrate
their business at one house. They had a general
meeting of the county organization at Waxahachie,
and sent a committee, inviting me into this
meeting, when I was requested to make them a proposition
to handle all of their business on a basis of
ten per cent profit. Not wishing to take advantage
of my competitors, I persuaded them not to make
such an arrangement, as it would not prove satisfactory,
especially to their families, being restricted
by contract on this basis to buy only at one house.
Entering into a full detail of the objections, I persuaded
them that it would not be to their interest
to make such a contract and induced them to drop it.</p>

<p>While I could have made a great deal of money
out of this proposition, I preferred to take no advantage
of my business neighbors, thereby incurring
petty jealousies and enmity, having in view the
building of a tap railroad to connect with the Houston
&amp; Texas Central, and it was of the greatest importance
for me to retain the friendship and the
confidence of the old business element, who were
the only men in the county of any great financial
ability.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXX<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>The Tap Railroad.</span></h2></div>

<p>Concerning the “Tap” Railroad just referred to,
I cannot better explain the trials and difficulties of
that time than by reprinting an article which I
wrote, some years ago, at the request of one of the
Waxahachie papers, which was anxious to clear up
the seeming mystery which enshrouded the building
of the “Tap.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>Dallas, Texas, Sept. 4th, 1912.</p>

<p class='noindent'>Editor Ellis County Herald,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:5em;'>Waxahachie, Texas.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir—Your valued favor of the 26th ult.,
requesting a history of the Waxahachie Tap Railroad
is at hand.</p>

<p>Complying with your courteous request, permit
me to assure you and my old friends that it is not
my purpose in this to ventilate old grievances at
the hands of people who were the greatest beneficiaries
of the building of the road, but simply to
state facts and to keep the record straight. Carefully
considering conditions existing at that time,
my board of directors were not so much to blame
for their want of confidence in the feasibility and
possibility of the enterprise, as this feeling was
shared largely by some of the best business men of
Houston and Galveston, but were to blame for allowing
one or two of their members to control their
action in opposing me. I incurred the enmity of
these directors through people’s expression of approval
of my efforts to accomplish what seemed to
them an impossible undertaking.</p>

<p>Entering into this labor of love, without promise
of fee or reward, with my board of directors (composed
of the principal business men of the town)
depreciating my business character by expressions
well calculated to bring about ruin, which they accomplished
in about two years, it required about
all the moral courage in my composition to determine
not to recognize such word as “failure.”</p>

<p>Have said this much in defense of this article,
which may prove hurtful to the feelings of friends
and descendants of the men who have claimed the
credit of building the road, but I cannot do otherwise
than adhere strictly to facts and truths, as all
fair-minded men who were then citizens of Ellis
County, still living, will bear me witness. I have
never had a public expression of thanks for the
enormous sacrifice to me then of ruining my splendid
prospect in business to save your town from
isolation and ruin.</p>

<p>The object in going into these details is only
to emphasize the claim of friends at that time that
I was the only man connected with it who did any
work, and if the “board” would quit meddling with
it, I would soon have the road built. These expressions
I tried my best to hold down, knowing
well it would increase their opposition to me. Another
object: There are few people now in your city
who know that I ever had anything to do with it,
but I consider it due my children to inscribe in my
own history one of the proudest acts of my business
career, representing two years of the best labor
of my life.</p>

<p>Please do not fail to note that I had to depend
on memory altogether for this article, hence its disconnected
character, and am entirely unable to supply
dates, which, however, is immaterial. I moved to
Waxahachie in 1873.</p>

<p>To give your readers a fair conception of existing
conditions at Waxahachie and Ellis County, I found
on my first visit to your town by stage from Ennis
that your merchants were still adhering to old-time
business methods; selling goods on time, at
large profits, thereby losing the most desirable
business; Ennis selling goods on an average of
twenty per cent less for cash, buying the farmer’s
produce, principally cotton, and paying cash therefor.
Waxahachie did not buy a bale of cotton for
cash, but only on account. The result was that
Ennis, though but a few years old, soon outgrew
Waxahachie, and aspired to be the county seat,
which caused a bitter feeling between the two communities.
Knowing the magnificent territory contiguous
to Waxahachie, I decided that with proper
efforts your town could be made one of the best
in the State, and arranged to locate there. Had I
supposed that to locate there, it was necessary to
ask the permission of the old business men, and then
conduct business as they directed, I would certainly
have gone elsewhere, but of this I was ignorant,
and after starting in, determined to exercise my
own judgment. I sold goods for cash, at reasonable
profit; bought cotton for cash, all that was offered,
paying Dallas prices; bought cotton from east of
Ennis and Palmer, then paid the farmer seventy-five
cents per bale to haul it back to the railroad
for shipment. Many of these farmers, after I paid
them the cash for cotton, would turn around and
spend every dollar of it with me for goods. I
bought cotton from Hill, Johnson and Bosque Counties,
and did not lose any money on it, although
my old competitors predicted that I would soon have
to quit. When disappointed in this, a few of the
progressive ones, Messrs. Pickett, Trippett and McLain,
joined in with me, and we soon established
in Waxahachie a good cotton market.</p>

<p>I now began planning for railroad connection,
and when I had my plans sufficiently matured, I
submitted them to a meeting of the business men,
who expressed grave doubt about the possibility
of the undertaking, and I only induced them to
enter into it by suggesting that an effort, even
though a failure, would have the result of throwing
Ennis on the defensive and induce them to drop
their county seat agitation. They then told me
to go ahead and get my plans fully matured, which
I submitted at a subsequent meeting, and which
were as follows: To get a charter for a Waxahachie
tap road with a State land grant of sixteen sections
to the mile and have the town issue bonds to the
limit of the law, which proved to be $75,000, then
augment this amount with farmers’ stock subscription
of $25,000 more; to sell these bonds at par
to the business men of Waxahachie and commission
merchants of Galveston and New York who were
doing business with Waxahachie—thus giving us
$100,000 cash and the State land grant to build the
road with. I stated this could only be done by
the adoption of second-hand iron, which I believed
could be had, and which would answer the purpose.
To buy new iron would cost several times the amount
of our cash asset, as it was then quoted at $85.00 a
ton at the mills. There was serious doubt about the
Legislature passing a bond bill at the time as they
had up the repudiation of international bond bill
granted under a fraudulent charter, and the International
Railroad Company had Galusha Grow of
Pennsylvania and John H. Burnett of Galveston at
Austin, trying to bulldoze Governor Coke and his
Legislature into the issuance of their bonds; hence
both the Governor and Legislature were committed
against the issue of bonds of the State in aid of
railroads. But I believed that Judge J. W. Ferris,
who was then one of the most eminent lawyers in
the State, and who, through his International bond
decision while acting as special Supreme Judge in
the case had endeared himself to the Governor and
Legislature, as well as the entire people of the
State, would be able to overcome this objection, as
we were only asking permission to tax our own town.
It was then determined to send Judge Ferris to
Austin for the purpose of obtaining a charter and
bond bill. The committee appointed to make the request
of the judge met his positive refusal, but he
stated at the same time that if it was attempted to
build the road, he would back the enterprise with
his money. I was now urged and finally persuaded
to go to Austin and endeavor to obtain the necessary
legislation. I called a meeting of the taxpayers of
Waxahachie, and explained to them that it was of
the utmost importance to get up a petition to the
Governor and Legislature, asking permission to tax
themselves, and I succeeded in obtaining every taxpayer’s
name to the petition. I then had the county
clerk examine the tax rolls and certify that he found
every taxpayer’s name to the same. I then proceeded
to Austin, armed with this petition, a letter
from Judge Ferris to Governor Coke, and from Dr.
Aldredge to friends in the Senate. On my arrival
at Austin, I met John H. Burnett and Galusha Grow
at the hotel, who proposed to me, if I would assist
them, they would assist me, which I declined, telling
them that I was opposed to the issuance of their
bonds, thus at the outset defining my position with
the Legislature. The next morning I sought and
obtained an audience with Governor Coke, presented
my letter from Judge Ferris and petition
from the taxpayers, and after reading this, the Governor
said, “Mr. Graber, I will promise you this,
if the Legislature passes your bills I will sign them.
The question involved in the International bill is the
taxing of the whole State to benefit the section
through which the road runs, but in your request
the good people of Waxahachie are only asking to
tax themselves to save their town.” I thanked the
Governor for his kind assurance and asked permission
to make the statement to the members of the
Legislature, which he readily gave. Though I had
never before looked inside a legislative hall I soon
felt perfectly at home and had the privilege of the
House and Senate. In my canvass of the House and
Senate I found little opposition to the bond bill
after reading our petition, but considerable objection
to the further donation of land in aid of railroads,
which, however, I was able to overcome by
satisfying them we would never be able to build our
road without it. As many of the influential members
were old army friends to whom I became indebted
for valuable assistance, I was able to return
home in three weeks, both bills having been signed
by Governor Coke a few weeks later. It would not
be inappropriate here to mention a little incident
to show a proper appreciation of my services at that
time. I had wired my wife that I would be home
on Saturday, but detained en route, I failed to make
it, which saved me considerable embarrassment, as
the stage was met a short distance from town by
the mayor, city council and concourse of citizens,
with a brass band, intending to give me an enthusiastic
reception. On the next Saturday a mass meeting
was held for the purpose of organizing under our
charter, and electing officers. At this meeting I
explained to them that I had taken the liberty of
stating to members of the Legislature that Judge
Ferris would be the president of the company, and
asked his election, telling them that it was all-important
the enterprise should be headed by the
most influential man in the community. Judge
Ferris being present, stated he could not under any
circumstances consider the acceptance of the position
as he did not have the time to give it the attention
necessary to make it a success, and placed
my name in nomination, which created great enthusiasm,
and it was attempted to be carried through
without further consideration. I tried to check this
movement, by telling them I had as little time to
spare from my business as Judge Ferris, had already
given them three weeks of most valuable time away
from my business and was unable to do anything
more than act on the board of directors, if they
saw fit to use me in that capacity; but the meeting
would not have it that way, and plainly told
me if I wanted the road built, I would have to
serve, and promised to sustain me with all the means
and power at their command. Under this assurance
I was finally persuaded to accept, and, after completing
the organization with Judge Ferris as vice-president,
the meeting adjourned subject to the call
of the president.</p>

<p>I forgot to explain that through the issuance of
the bonds, it was agreed that the town should be
issued stock to the amount, thus every taxpayer became
a stockholder and was entitled to vote in the
organization. While at Austin, in company with
some members of the Legislature, I called on General
Braxton Bragg, who had just come to Texas with
a party of civil engineers, with the intention of
making this his home—he was anxious to get a
first job and promised me he would undertake the
location of our road at his actual cost (estimated
not to exceed 500 dollars). As soon as organized
I took up a correspondence with him, and entered
into a contract to run three preliminary lines and
cross section the line adopted, furnish plans and
specifications of a first-class road. He surveyed
one line to Ennis, one to Palmer and one to the
nearest point on the H. &amp; T. C., which was adopted.
We next advertised for bids for the whole work
complete, contractor furnishing the road complete,
ready for operation, except equipment, and another
for the grading only. We had a bid on each, one
from John McCarthy of Kansas City, who was returning
from Galveston, where he had in a bid for
a large contract with the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa
Fe and had lost out. He carefully examined our
assets, which were one hundred and eighty-five sections
(estimated) of land certificates to be issued
by the State (the line being 11 45-100 miles long),
$75,000 of Waxahachie bonds and about $13,000 of
farmers’ stock subscriptions which I had secured
by hard labor, and in which I had valuable assistance
from Judge Anson Rainey, who was then
a young lawyer in Judge Ferris’ office. Mr. McCarthy,
satisfied with our assets, submitted a proposition
to deliver us the road complete as per General
Bragg’s specification, except to substitute fifty-six
pounds of good second-hand iron approved by
General Bragg, which was considered sufficient for
our purpose, in consideration for our entire assets,
and complete the same in two years. We also had
a proposal from Roach Brothers &amp; Tierney for the
grade only at thirteen cents per yard. As John
McCarthy’s bid was the best for us we awarded
him the contract, and immediately notified him
by wire at Kansas City, to which we received a
reply from his wife, by letter, saying Mr. McCarthy
was not at home, but we would hear from him as
soon as he returned. In the meantime I wired General
Bragg at Galveston, who was the chief engineer
of the G., C. &amp; S. F. for a report on Mr. McCarthy,
but had his answer, “Drop him.” This in connection
with an indefinite letter finally received from
McCarthy, made me conclude it best to let him alone.
In the meantime, I had induced Mr. Roach to hold
his bid open (which was 13 cents per yard, one-third
cash, one-third in bonds and one-third in provisions
and forage he expected to use to feed his
teams and men) until we heard definitely from
John McCarthy and in case of his failure to make
us a good bond, and furnish us ample evidence
of his ability and good intentions, we would give
him the contract for the grade, as in his bid. After
our decision to drop Mr. John McCarthy, we entered
into a contract with Roach Brothers &amp; Tierney for
the grade, to go to work at once—as he had his
outfit at Fort Worth already. He was on the
ground sooner than expected, and gave us only a
few days to prepare for a formal beginning of the
work. We wanted to celebrate the event with a great
barbecue. On account of the short time for notifying
the farmers, the board of directors opposed my
plans of having the celebration, but I determined
to have it anyway, and sent out invitations to all
interested in the building of the Waxahachie Tap,
to join us in celebrating the commencement of the
work. I solicited a few of our best farmers to donate
the meats, which they did cheerfully in the
greatest abundance. The day set apart for the celebration,
the farmers began to arrive in the early
morning in large numbers—not only our own Ellis
County people, but a large number from Hill and
adjoining counties, and by one o’clock the crowd
was variously estimated at from 1500 to 2000 men,
women and children. Such a large enthusiastic
gathering had never been known in this part of
the State. The board of directors had in the meantime
concluded to join in with us, and, although
they had told me they would have nothing to do with
it, had ordered carriages, and I was invited to a
seat with Mr. John C. Gibson, who informed me
they had not prepared any program, which I had
asked them to do in the morning. I asked Mr. Gibson
his age, and found he was the oldest man on
the board. When everything was ready, I was
handed a spade by Mr. Roach, who stated that it
devolved on me to turn the first dirt. I climbed on
top of a wagon bed with the spade and addressed
the crowd in a few words which I remember about
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Fellow Citizens: We are proud to see so many
of you here, manifesting, by your presence, an interest
in our work; an interest on your part it has
been charged did not exist, particularly with our
farmers, who recognize that they are as much interested
in the building of this road as our town.
The doubting Thomases will directly witness actual
beginning of the work by our contractor, Mr. Roach,
who has one of the best-equipped grading outfits
in the country and will push his work to an early
completion. Upon such occasions it is customary
for the president of the company to turn the first
dirt, an honor which on this occasion I turn over
to Colonel John C. Gibson, the oldest member of
the board of directors.” I then turned the spade
over to Mr. Gibson, who eagerly accepted the honor
and performed the duty. Mr. Roach having his
teams ready, then proceeded with the work. Permit
me to say here, that it proved a grand sight
to everybody present, the most of whom had never
seen anything like it, to see about fifty splendid
teams with their scrapers turning up the ground,
and the moral effect at that time cannot be overestimated,
as the effort of Waxahachie’s building
of a railroad had been ridiculed by people interested
in our failure, particularly the people of Ennis. I
omitted to mention, I visited Ennis before we definitely
determined on a location, and to a meeting of
their business men, submitted a proposition to adopt
their line for a subsidy of twenty thousand dollars,
which created considerable ridicule, but I told them
they might laugh as much as they pleased, the road
would be built and some day would become a main
line by an extension east and west, and though the
point of junction might never become a rival town,
it would always prove a standing menace to their
town, and prevent capital from locating with them.
How well my judgment was founded is proven by
the result. On the completion of the road to Fort
Worth, this road has furnished more tonnage than
the main line from Garrett to Denison, which no
doubt proved a great surprise to the H. &amp; T. C.
management, who had expressed themselves unwilling
to operate it for its earnings—hence I had
to conclude a traffic arrangement with them to
enable us to operate it. Then, again, when the
Central undertook its extension from Garrett east,
Ennis sent a committee to Houston to try to secure
this connection, and failed, although it was rumored
they were instructed to offer a bonus of one hundred
thousand dollars. I also forgot to mention that
before the adoption of the Garrett line, I secured a
donation of one hundred acres of land from Mr.
Garrett, divided into town lots—this in spite of the
strenuous opposition of his agent, Mr. Neal. Mr.
Garrett at that time resided somewhere in East
Texas. After the commencement of the work it
soon became evident that I must get to work and
sell bonds outside of Waxahachie; we were needing
cash to meet payments to Mr. Roach—although I had
an understanding with our business men, that they
would take as much as ten thousand dollars, at par,
they were slow to come up with their money—I
therefore made a trip to Galveston for the purpose
of selling $20,000 of our town bonds. I called on
Mr. R. S. Willis, who was then the president of
the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Road. Mr. Willis
was a good friend of mine and I was buying my
goods of him largely. He said, “Mr. Graber, let
me advise you to drop that scheme, it is visionary,
you can never build the road. Attend to your own
business. If you were to succeed, you would never
receive thanks for it. I’ll not subscribe one cent.”
I said, “Mr. Willis, I appreciate your advice, and
esteem your judgment highly, but must decline to
be governed by it. We are going to build that road.”</p>

<p>I next called on Ball, Hutchins &amp; Company, and
Mr. Seeley asked, “Have you been to see Mr. Willis?”
I told him I had and had his refusal. He
then asked to be excused. Walking down the street,
I met Mr. W. L. Moody, in front of his place of
business. He expressed himself as glad to see me, and
said, “I see in the News you are down here for the
purpose of placing $20,000 of your Waxahachie
bonds; step into the office. Colonel Jameson will
put us down for a thousand dollars.” He furthermore
said, “When you get your $20,000 placed
here, I think I can place the balance for you in
New York.” I thanked him, took their $1000 subscription,
and dropped into Leon H. Blum’s. Met
Leon coming out. He said, “Go back in the office,
tell brother Sylvan to put down a thousand dollars
for us.” I next called on several other commission
houses, who assured me they would subscribe,
but could not just then. It soon became evident
to my mind they wanted their customers personally
to ask them. I therefore concluded to return home,
and induce my board of directors, who were all shipping
cotton to different houses to assist me in the
matter, by going down with me, but could not induce
them to go. This want of interest on the part
of the board at that critical period was indeed discouraging.
They well knew that the taking of
$10,000 by Waxahachie and $20,000 more by our
commercial city at par, would establish the solid
character of the bonds in New York, but they were
unwilling to spare the time and incur the expense.
Could there have been anything more discouraging?
It seemed as though they were determined that I
should not succeed, and did not want the road built,
which was talked frequently by people in Waxahachie
as elsewhere. They seemed afraid of inviting
competition in their business, and preferred to continue
as they had. Meeting with Major Douglas
of Tyler one day in Galveston, he said to me,
“Graber, why don’t you go ahead and build your
little road?” I gave an evasive answer. He said,
“I know what is the matter—you have seven old
mossbacks pulling back.” He said, “My board of
directors told me to go ahead and build the road,
and I am doing it. I have not had a meeting of
my board since I commenced.” Major Douglas was
then building the Tyler Tap Road and was president
of that company.</p>

<p>I now began looking around to secure iron, ties
and bridge work. I soon had the latter promised
by our carpenters for stock—there were only a few
small culverts and bridges. On one of my trips to
Houston I met Mr. H. M. Hoxie, general superintendent
of the International &amp; Great Northern Railroad,
with whom I was well acquainted, who was
changing the iron on the Galveston road to a heavier
lot. He made me a proposition to furnish us sufficient
iron for our road, taken up from the Galveston
road, which was fifty-six pound and in good condition,
subject to our inspection, for $20,000 f. o. b.
cars at Houston, which proposition I accepted subject
to the approval of my board. I had a contract
with the Houston &amp; Texas Central Railroad to haul
iron, ties and bridge timber, for stock in our road.
In about a month’s time I had a wire from Mr.
Hoxie, “Come down, inspect and receive the iron.
Answer.” I immediately had a meeting of the board
and asked their consent to close the deal, but they
wanted time to consider. “Wait and see what the
crop is going to do; where is your money?” etc. I
told them I was satisfied I could induce Hoxie to
accept bonds. But they insisted on waiting. I
begged and plead with them not to lose this splendid
chance of securing iron, which they certainly would
by waiting, telling them it might be lost to us in
three days. There were other tap roads building—the
towns of Henderson, Georgetown and Tyler
were all busy, but my pleadings were in vain.</p>

<p>I now felt that I must give up, I could do nothing
more. They were determined that I should not
complete the road; in fact, it seemed they did not
want it at all, and I immediately tendered my resignation,
which was promptly accepted, and John C.
Gibson elected to succeed me. As soon as it became
known that I had resigned, the people demanded
of the board to send me down to close the
deal for the iron, and soon the secretary came with
a request for me to close the deal and a tender of
the money to pay my expenses. I told him I was
ready to waive all personal feeling in the matter
and now go down in a private capacity, close the
deal and have my successor sign the contract, as
my only ambition was to see the road completed,
even by a set of men that deserved no consideration
at my hands, but that I must wire Hoxie first and
know if iron was still on hand. I wired Mr. Hoxie
at Houston and received no answer. I repeated the
wire the next day and had his answer, “Too late,
iron sold.” This proved a surprise and disappointment
to all concerned and for a time it seemed
as though Waxahachie was doomed. I had turned
over to my successor and his board, the grade, a
splendid piece of work completed and paid for;
sixty-five thousand dollars in Waxahachie bonds; a
farmers’ stock subscription of about eight thousand
dollars; about one hundred and eighty-five sections
of State land certificates to be issued on the
completion of the road, and every alternate lot in
the town of Garrett out of the subdivision of one
hundred acres.</p>

<p>The board now went to sleep over the situation;
they had no one to suggest or try to do anything
towards the completion of the road, which, for
nearly three years was a dead enterprise—and left
the board with an investment in bonds of about
$6000, which would prove worthless unless the road
was completed under the terms and provisions of
the charter, which were: the completion and operation
of the road within five years. They now got
desperate, and induced Mr. Royal A. Ferris to go
to New York and offer the charter and its franchises,
and all of the assets of the company to any
responsible party that would complete it, even with
old iron, and run a train in before the expiration
of the time in the charter. Mr. Ferris succeeded in
inducing a Mr. Riordan to accept the proposition.
He went to work and completed the road, and after
a few months’ operation, demonstrating to the Central
people its value, sold out to Mr. Waldo for account
of some individual stockholder of the H. &amp;
T. C. what Waldo termed a pretty good bank of
dirt with two streaks of rust for $85,000. In the
hands of the Central it was soon refurnished with
new iron and completely overhauled, making it a
first-class road, and soon extended to Fort Worth.</p>

<p>This terminated the history of the Waxahachie
Tap Road in the loss of all interest the town had in
it through the farcical conduct of its leading business
men, acting as its board of directors.</p>

<p>When a meeting was held just before the election
on the bond proposition, I told the people, as
long as I could control it, if they would vote the
bonds, the road should never pass into other hands,
only with their consent, and should pay its value.
It was my intention to hold on to the State land
donation until it would become valuable and already
had the promise of a few surveyors to locate the
same free of cost, save actual expenses. I believed
then the land within our day and time could be sold
for from $5 to $10 per acre, which would amply reimburse
the town for its issuance of the bonds, and
they would own the road besides. The result was,
we had a unanimous vote on the bond. To fairly illustrate
the character of the men I was connected
with in this enterprise, some few years after the
Santa Fe was completed west of Waxahachie, we
had a proposition from the management to build
a branch of their road into Waxahachie for a bonus
of $10,000. A meeting to consider the proposition
was held; and these men who were still in control,
expressed themselves as opposed to meeting the Santa
Fe proposition, saying, If they propose to build in
here for $10,000 they will do so anyway. Realizing
that they were about to lose another valuable opportunity,
I told them that I came to subscribe my
money and not to talk, knowing well any suggestion
I might make would fall flat, but felt that they
were about to make a serious mistake in turning
down this proposition; there were movements
being made on the railroad checkerboard constantly
and something might occur that would force the
Santa Fe Company to withdraw their proposition
in less than thirty days, and rather than have this
happen I was willing to subscribe $1000. One of the
old members of the board of railroad directory
smiled at my suggestion, and made a motion to adjourn
sine die, which was carried and thus Waxahachie
was again cheated out of another golden opportunity;
as in less than thirty days this company
had to withdraw its proposition on account of a
trouble with the Gould lines. When about three
months after Mr. N. A. McMillan was sent to Galveston
to have them renew or make another proposition,
Mr. R. S. Willis told him they could not
consider such a thing; that they had all they could
do to look after their main line; but frankly told
him, “You people missed your opportunity. Had
you accepted our proposition when we made it, we
would have built into your town.”</p>

</div>

<p>I have thus given an important part of Waxahachie
history, which I trust will prove instructive
in its future. There are great opportunities presented
every now and then, which should be taken advantage
of and properly cared for by the progressive
citizens of a community and should be ably seconded
by a public spirit. This is due from every
man who is a beneficiary of the growth of his home
city.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that in the period
when we first submitted the railroad proposition,
Texas had hardly felt the great benefits of railroads
and it was difficult to induce small communities
to take hold of such enterprises; besides there
was no money with which to build them.</p>

<p>It is easier now to build a long line of road, provided
it is practicable and the inducement sufficient,
than at that period of time to build a little
tap road.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must be pardoned for a seeming
egotism in claiming to be the originator and having
done the principal work in this enterprise, but I
cannot do otherwise and state facts. Whilst it is
true that others completed the road, it was comparatively
an easy task to do this by giving it away.
The only recognition I have ever had for my efforts
in behalf of your town was an occasional expression
from prominent citizens whom I met in years after:
“Well, Mr. Graber, if you had not come to Waxahachie
when you did, our town would have been an
old rat hole.”—Dr. Conner. “Mr. Graber, they
treated you badly.”—Captain Patrick. And other
like expressions, but permit me to say I feel compensated
in the fact that I was probably instrumental
in starting your town on its upward march, and
therefore feel that I have been of benefit to others,
and have not lived in vain.</p>

<p>Thanking you for this courtesy, I am with great
respect,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>Yours very truly,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>H. W. GRABER.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXXI<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>Business Troubles.</span></h2></div>

<p>The second year of my labors in building the
Waxahachie Tap Road required all of my time, and,
in consequence, a neglect of my business. This,
coupled with the fact that many good farmers
seemed to shun my business, fearing I would tackle
them for a railroad stock subscription and the further
fact that jealous competitors, joined by a man
representing P. J. Willis &amp; Brother of Galveston, a
house I was dealing with most extensively and with
whom I had a credit and a running account of about
twelve or fifteen thousand dollars, and the representations
of these competitors that I was investing
heavily in the tap road, which was not a fact, caused
me to become embarrassed in business. I paid my
account with P. J. Willis &amp; Brother in order to get
rid of this jealous competitor, and this amounted
to a withdrawal of fifteen thousand dollars of my
capital.</p>

<p>In November of that year I owed nearly twenty-three
thousand dollars, which I reduced to ninety-four
hundred dollars by the first of March following.</p>

<p>At this time I was caught with a remnant winter
stock and, in order to keep up my business and to
arrange for a spring and summer stock of goods
with no money to buy, I decided best to proceed to
St. Louis and submit a statement of my condition
to my creditors. This statement showed an indebtedness,
as stated, of about ninety-four hundred
dollars, and assets, about fifteen or sixteen thousand.
These assets consisted largely of East Texas accounts,
a balance of my old Rusk business, a winter
stock of goods and a few acres of land in East
Texas that could not be sold for more than a dollar
an acre. At that time, everything I had in
business was unavailable.</p>

<p>The object of my St. Louis trip was to get an
extension of my indebtedness until the next winter.
The largest part of my indebtedness was with L.
Cannon &amp; Company of Galveston, cotton commission
merchants, who were satisfied with any arrangement
I made for an extension. The next
largest creditor was Samuel C. Davis &amp; Company,
St. Louis, whom I owed a balance on open account
of about eight or nine hundred dollars. After submitting
them my statement, the manager, whose
name I have forgotten, told me that I was not entitled
to an extension and they were not in favor
of granting it unless the balance all agreed, but
if they all granted an extension, that they were
willing to do so, but would not sell me any more
goods. They explained to me that upon a review
of my assets, I would not be able to pay more than
thirty or thirty-five cents on the dollar, and if I succeeded
in compromising on that basis, they were
willing to sell me again, on their regular terms, any
reasonable amount and would consider my credit
unimpaired. I told the gentlemen that I would never
compromise, as it was considered disgraceful in
Texas.</p>

<p>I next went to see the house of Hamilton &amp;
Brown, who were then in their infancy in their business,
but were considered one of the rising shoe
houses in St. Louis.</p>

<p>On presenting my statement their judgment was
the same as Samuel C. Davis &amp; Company: that I was
not entitled to an extension and to continue in business,
having to ask further credit, my only course
would be to compromise, say thirty cents on the dollar.
I owed these people little less than two hundred
dollars, a small balance of a considerable account.
I told them I would never compromise, when
one of the gentlemen said, “You are working with
a millstone around your neck and we want to put
you on your feet. If you don’t compromise before
you leave St. Louis, we will send your account to
an attorney at Waxahachie, with instructions to
sue.” I said, “If you do, I will make an assignment
and quit business, and in doing so you can
take the coat off my back—you will never find me
behind a valuable Texas homestead.” In connection
with this I will state that after a two weeks’ stay in
St. Louis, trying to persuade these people to meet
my proposition, I heard from my friend Cannon in
Galveston, who offered to let me have money to
settle with the St. Louis creditors on the basis of
thirty-five cents. I finally gave it up and on my
return home found the Hamilton &amp; Brown account
in the hands of Judge Rainey for collection with
order to bring suit, and I immediately made an assignment
in the Bankruptcy Court at Tyler, thereby
protecting all of my creditors.</p>

<p>When the United States Marshal came and took
possession of my assets he persuaded me, for the
protection of my family, to retain two hundred
acres of land in Cherokee County, which at the
time could not have been sold for more than a
dollar an acre, for which I had paid two dollars
and seventy-five cents an acre. This land I traded
for a few town lots in Waxahachie, on one of which
I built an humble little home the next year and
out of the balance realized about three hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that my business
failure proved very discouraging at the time and
caused the breaking down of my general health.
My jealous competitors in business continued to
refer to it, claiming that it was injuring the prospect
of the building of the road, the presidency of
which I finally concluded to resign.</p>

<p>Considering that several of these men were the
richest of any men in the community and that I had
sacrificed my all to build up their interest in connection
with the town, I felt that it was one of the
most unjust and worst cases of persecution without
cause a man ever had to submit to, but I determined
to outgrow it and ignore these foolish people’s
work against me.</p>

<p>Recurring to my visit in St. Louis where, as
stated, I spent a couple of weeks: I stopped at a
private boarding house, where I formed the acquaintance
of a business gentleman, who, with his
wife, had a room next to mine and in a few days
invited me to visit their cotton exchange, which invitation
I accepted. I, of course, had not told him
of my financial embarrassment, but had made him
acquainted with my railroad enterprise.</p>

<p>At the cotton exchange I was shown a great deal
of attention by some of the members present and
especially Mr. J. W. Paramore, the president. When
about ready to depart Mr. Paramore extended me
an invitation to join him in a visit to his compresses,
saying that he had a horse and buggy at
the door, waiting. I accepted his invitation.. On our
drive out to the compresses, he gave me his history
in connection with the business, saying that he came
to St. Louis from Nashville, Tennessee, with seventy
thousand dollars in cash and decided that St. Louis
ought to be made a cotton market. For this purpose
he met some of the leading business men and
suggested the building of a large compress and
asked them to take stock, which they considered
a huge joke and readily turned down his proposition.
He then concluded to undertake the building of a
compress by himself, which he did, meeting with
great success the first season. These same men whom
he tried to induce to take stock with him, came to
him and begged for stock, with the proposition to
enlarge the plant, which he did and had made it a
great success the second year. The enlarged plant enabled
him to pay a handsome dividend. After showing
me around his compresses and expressing himself
much interested in Texas cotton shipments, I finally
suggested to him the idea of getting up an excursion
of a number of his business friends who were
interested to know about Texas conditions and
resources, to visit Waxahachie, where I was anxious
to show him our little railroad enterprise and especially
our rich land in this black land district.</p>

<p>Meeting with him again upon another occasion
I again urged him by all means to get up this excursion,
satisfied that he and his friends would find
it interesting and profitable, and having no doubt
but they would succeed in opening business relations.
I found he was much interested and he became
somewhat enthusiastic on the proposed visit,
promising me that he would certainly do so.</p>

<p>Some three or four months after, I saw an account
in the Galveston News of where J. W. Paramore,
a business man of St. Louis, with a number of
other business men, had arrived at Tyler, Texas,
on an excursion to investigate Texas resources and
conditions, with a view of establishing business relations
and will here state, knowing the business community
of Tyler, its brains and capital, I immediately
concluded that their proposed Waxahachie
visit was doomed, which proved to be a fact.</p>

<p>Tyler had just completed a short line narrow-gauge
railway to connect with the Texas &amp; Pacific
at Big Sandy and soon induced Mr. Paramore and
associates to buy this road and extend it, an independent
line, to St. Louis, which, after a few years,
they accomplished, creating the St. Louis Narrow
Gauge, and after a few more years, changed it into
a standard gauge, which is now the Cotton Belt.</p>

<p>I trust the reader will not consider me egotistical,
but I have always taken a great pride in the belief
that I was perhaps instrumental in having one of
the great lines of railroad built from our State to
St. Louis. Had I not suggested this excursion to
Texas by these St. Louis people, which was altogether
a new idea with Paramore and his friends,
the St. Louis Narrow Gauge might never have been
built. It was only through just such men as Paramore
that great enterprises are started in their
infancy and carried to a successful realization.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXXII<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>I Start Anew.</span></h2></div>

<p>Immediately after my failure in the general mercantile
business, I went to Dallas to try to make
some commission deal to sell farm machinery, and
called on Mitchell &amp; Scruggs, who had just opened
business with one of the best lines of machinery in
Dallas and had the State agencies on these lines.
I succeeded in making a contract with them to
handle these goods in Ellis, Navarro, Hill and Johnson
Counties on a basis of five and ten per cent. I
knew nothing about machinery and had to post
myself, reading catalogues and asking questions of
Mitchell &amp; Scruggs and the factories they represented.</p>

<p>Having no money I bought a few groceries on
time, until I could make something and had the
tender of a horse and buggy from a Mr. Johnson,
the pastor of our Presbyterian Church. I drove
over these counties, very often without a road, especially
in Hill County, visiting people who were
reported in need of cotton gin machinery, harvesters
and threshers, never making a dollar for nearly five
months. I finally made my first sale of an Ames
engine, on which I had a commission of eight per
cent. For the next three months succeeding I sold
a number of engines and boilers, several threshers,
a number of harvesters, etc., winding up the first
season with a net profit of about fifteen hundred
dollars. After paying my debts I had left about
five hundred dollars to invest in a home. I planned
a cottage, which Meredith &amp; Patterson agreed to
build for me for a thousand dollars, accept in part
payment five hundred dollars and the balance of
five hundred dollars, payable next fall with five per
cent per month interest.</p>

<p>The next season’s business I wound up with a
profit of twenty-eight hundred dollars and the next
season with thirty-five hundred dollars profit and
the next season with something over ten thousand
dollars profit. This put me on my feet but I needed
engineering skill and was unable to secure it, as it
was scarce in Texas at the time.</p>

<p>Having formed the acquaintance of Colonel John
G. Hunter (through his visit to me, in the interest of
the Ames Iron Works, whose engines and boilers I
was handling), I persuaded Mr. Leonard Ames the
first time he called on me in conjunction with Colonel
Hunter, to let me have Hunter, he was just the
man I needed. He finally consented, provided it
was agreeable to Hunter. I made a proposition to
Hunter to give him a half interest in the profits of
the business, which he accepted and after a copartnership
of two years, we both decided that our territory
was too small; our business too much circumscribed
to justify the services of both, when I advised
him to go to Dallas, both realizing that it
would be the future commercial center of Texas.
He decided to do this and immediately moved
to Dallas, where his ability found better compensation
and I told him that I would follow as soon as
I could wind up my business here, realizing that
Waxahachie would never amount to much until the
old mossback element died out and the young men
would get into the saddle, which prediction I believe
has been realized.</p>

<p>Before leaving Waxahachie I tried to get up the
money for a cotton compress, for which I was authorized
by a friend at Jefferson, Texas, who had a
compress at that point, to subscribe for him ten
thousand dollars of about thirty-five thousand dollars
needed for a good Morse ninety-inch cylinder
press. I headed the subscriptions with this man’s
ten thousand dollars and added mine for one thousand
more, then called on a number of business men,
financially able, besides the two banks, who all
agreed to take stock provided a certain somebody
else would take stock. It finally resolved itself
into the consent of one, John G. Williams, who was
always arbitrary and dictatorial. When I asked him
to subscribe a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars,
telling him that it was important for us to take
immediate action, as Ennis was also trying to get
up a compress company and there was not sufficient
business for both, he insisted on postponing it, saying
that he would let me know when he got ready.</p>

<p>Already disgusted with such dilatory conduct, I
told him I wanted him to understand that I was not
begging him nor others, like I used to do when trying
to build the railroad, that I had other business to attend
to and I wanted him to say right then and
there what he was going to do. He told me to take
the compress and go to the devil with it. I said to
him, taking the subscription list, “Here goes,” and
tore it up, leaving him in disgust.</p>

<p>The town of Ennis commenced building their
compress in less than three days, but the conduct of
these old mossbacks, in this case, finally proved the
straw that broke the camel’s back. I immediately
resolved to get out of there as soon as possible and
move to Dallas, which I have never had cause to
regret.</p>

<p>After moving to Dallas I succeeded in making
better contracts with the factories whose goods I
had been handling through Mitchell &amp; Scruggs, and
had a number of contracts, which they had held,
turned over to me direct, thereby enlarging the
profits of my business from fifty to one hundred
per cent and soon established one of the largest and
best businesses in my line in Dallas, except that of
R. V. Tompkins, who had large capital and more
extensive factory arrangements than mine. Having
large capital he was able to employ a large corps
of traveling salesmen, besides he, himself, having a
practical, thorough knowledge of machinery.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXXIII<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>The Methodist School at Waxahachie.</span></h2></div>

<p>I forgot to mention, soon after entering the commission
machinery business, I met a friend by the
name of Meeks who was the owner of the Marvin
College property at Waxahachie, established and
built up by the Methodist Church of Texas, and governed
by a Board of Trustees who had permitted the
school to go down, after having been in operation for
perhaps two or three years. They borrowed ten thousand
dollars in gold from my friend, Meeks, giving
him a first mortgage on the property, which mortgage
he had to close by public sale and had to take
the property for the debt, though the trustees claimed
that the property cost the church about a hundred
thousand dollars. The same old mossback element
that persecuted me in my railroad and other business,
too, were largely responsible for the failure of
Marvin College and boasted that it should never succeed
again. Mr. Meeks asked me to undertake the
sale of it, which of course could be used only for
school purposes, as it was unfit for anything else.
Having received his promise that he would give me
full control of the sale of it, I agreed to take hold of
it for a commission of ten per cent.</p>

<p>I immediately went to work, got out an attractive
circular letter, giving advantages of Waxahachie for
an educational point. I soon had responses, or inquiries
from the North and East, and a strong one
from a Presbyterian school man at Lexington, Kentucky,
who decided to take hold of it as soon as he
could dispose of his property in Lexington.</p>

<p>Finding that I was about to sell the property to
a Presbyterian who did not expect to make it a denominational
school, the trustees of the Methodist
Church, composed of Captain V. G. Veal, Fred Cox
and Doctor Walkup, got busy among their Methodist
friends and secured authority to take the property
over again for ten thousand dollars in gold,
Meeks waiving the interest, and paid me a thousand
dollars cash and three thousand dollars in one, two
and three years, with a mortgage on the property.
In selling them the property on these liberal terms,
I had it distinctly understood that if they failed to
come up with their second payment I would close
them out at once, which I was forced to do.</p>

<p>I soon got into correspondence with General L.
M. Lewis, an educator of high order, then connected
with a college in Little Rock, though he had already
been connected with the A. &amp; M. College at Bryan,
where the faculty had a rupture, which resulted in
the resignation of the whole board. I induced General
Lewis to visit Waxahachie, where I introduced
him to the Rev. Chas. E. Brown of the Methodist
Church, who was one of the most popular preachers
there and he, in turn, got him acquainted with Fred
Cox and Doctor Walkup. These four gentlemen
formed a copartnership and again bought the property
and in less than two years built up a large
school with many transient boarders. While on a
deal with General Lewis, I frankly told him that he
would have a difficult task to build up a school in
that town on account of the sworn opposition of
the mossback element and that he would have to
depend upon transient patronage altogether for the
success of his school when they began, having no
doubt that Waxahachie’s patronage would gradually
follow.</p>

<p>As I predicted, soon after starting the school and
having the children of Mr. John G. Williams, who
tried to be the boss of the town, Williams demanded
of General Lewis that he make a change in certain
rules and General Lewis told him that if the rules
didn’t suit him he had better take his children home,
which he did and the faculty were not sorry for it.</p>

<p>The second year of the school, having paid their
indebtedness to Meeks, a demand for an addition
became imperative, so they borrowed money and put
up a large one, as also a separate boarding house.
After two years more, the free school system of Texas
obtained, thereby cutting down their patronage
to a point that did not justify them to continue and
were finally induced to sell out to the city for a
public free school, which they had to do, at a considerable
loss and thus crippled them financially.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXXIV<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>My Later Business Experiences.</span></h2></div>

<p>The Rev. Charles E. Brown had the business
management of this college from the beginning to
the end and displayed business capacity and indomitable
persistence that impressed me with the idea
that he would make a good business man. He came
to me, asking for employment, saying that he wanted
to enter commerce, that he had a number of
children to educate and the pulpit did not support
his family as he wished. He wanted to give his children
as good an education as anybody else’s children,
and for this reason he wanted to go to work
in business, offering to work for me for fifty dollars
per month, in the sales department, until he was
worth more.</p>

<p>Being sadly in need of assistance, I told Brown
that I believed he had the ability to make good in
the machinery business and if he proved the man
that I was needing, I would give him a third interest
in the profits of the business.</p>

<p>After a short time I found that I was not mistaken
in the man and voluntarily raised his compensation
to one-half interest of the profits in the
business. Our business prospered and grew to a
point that it was necessary for us to move to Dallas,
which we did, where our business continued to grow
and was considered, after a couple of years, the
leading machinery house in the city, except that
of R. V. Tompkins.</p>

<p>Owing to some misapprehension on Brown’s part,
(brought about by a statement of his oldest boy,
whom he had employed in the business against my
advice), differences arose which we were unable to
reconcile and it was deemed best, under the circumstances,
that we separate.</p>

<p>Having made him a liberal offer of ten thousand
dollars for his interest in the business, besides the
cancellation of his account, which amounted to six
or seven thousand dollars and had his refusal to sell
out, I then decided to sell out to him, provided he
could induce a certain W. J. Clark, who was reputed
worth a hundred thousand dollars, to join him in
the purchase, which he succeeded in doing. I then
sold out to Clark &amp; Brown for a nominal sum,
without taking a dollar out of the business until all
debts were paid, taking their note for the purchase
price. They paid all debts when due and then paid
me.</p>

<p>On the dissolution of our firm and my sale to
Clark &amp; Brown, I notified all creditors that Clark
&amp; Brown were obligated to pay one hundred cents
on the dollar promptly when due and if they failed
to receive their money on that basis, to notify me
promptly, as I was in position to make them do so.
Never receiving any notice from any creditor that
their matters were unsettled, I had every reason to
believe Brown &amp; Clark’s statement that they had
settled all indebtedness.</p>

<p>After a rest of several months I had a proposition
made me by Mr. C. A. Keating, President of the
Keating Implement &amp; Machine Company, to take
the management of their machinery department, succeeding
in that position Colonel John G. Hunter and
John Young, both excellent business men.</p>

<p>I expected to take stock in the Keating Implement
&amp; Machinery Company, but finally decided not
to do so and simply worked on salary, commencing
the first year with a salary of sixteen hundred and
fifty dollars, when at the close of the season, Mr.
Keating voluntarily paid me two thousand, then the
next season raised my salary to twenty-five hundred.
After my connection with the house for eleven years,
the last three years of the time receiving thirty-six
hundred dollars, I voluntarily resigned, under
the protest of Mr. C. A. Keating. After I severed
my connection with the house, they quit the machinery
business, except threshers and some other goods
that were not included in my department.</p>

<p>After severing my connection with the Keating
Implement &amp; Machine Company I went into business
again, for my own account, on very limited capital
and in a few years again built up a large machinery
business, finally discontinuing cotton gin
machinery, in which I was largely instrumental in
inducing the Pratt Cotton Gin Company to enter the
field with a complete system, which I assisted in
developing.</p>

<p>On the formation of the Continental Gin Company,
which took over the plants of four or five
others, including my Pratt factory, I decided to drop
gin machinery and confine my business to larger and
high duty plants, in which I succeeded to my entire
satisfaction. My success in this business was
somewhat phenomenal. As heretofore stated, I was
not an educated practical engineer, but in the organization
of this new business I was careful to
hunt up the record of every machine and its factory
before its adoption, taking great care to get hold
of the best and I don’t think I ever made a mistake,
as many of my customers repeated their orders,
after having tried and used the machines.</p>

<p>Among the list of my machinery I would mention
the American Diesel Engine, which was just being
introduced in the United States and was largely
owned by Mr. Adolphus Busch.</p>

<p>I was persuaded to take hold of the introduction
of this engine through a promise of Colonel Meyer,
who undertook its introduction in this country, with
his headquarters in New York, and who had known
me for fifteen or twenty years, in connection with
his Heine boiler business, which I had been handling
and continued to handle.</p>

<p>Relying on his promise that if I would undertake
the introduction of the engine, that I should
continue to handle it exclusively in the Southwestern
territory, and believing that on account of its
enormous economy it would ultimately supplant all
steam machinery, I did not hesitate to put my whole
efforts and influence into the work of its introduction.</p>

<p>After putting about five years of the best labor
of my latter years into its establishment, and just
at a time when I felt I was going to realize something
handsome out of the business, my health gave
way to an extent that forced me to quit business altogether,
never having had a real vacation and rest
in forty-three years.</p>

<p>In winding up the history of my business career
I regret to have to record that throughout the whole
of it I was always the victim of misplaced confidence,
never realizing any of the men I had associated
with me would ever do me a wrong, in which
I was nearly always mistaken.</p>

<p>I am able to say that I had associated with me
men whom I trained in several lines of business, in
fact, assisted in starting them, and some of them
have attained great success, a number of them now
occupying high positions. One of the wealthiest
manufacturers in Dallas is a man whom I took up on
the street, hunting work. It was largely through a
kind, friendly feeling, I took hold of him and taught
him the cotton gin machinery business. He proved
one of the best salesmen I had and, as stated, is now
the president of the largest manufacturing cotton
gin machinery in the South. Another one of my old
clerks in the mercantile business, is today the president
of a big trust company, commanding a salary
of twenty-five thousand dollars a year. While I refer
to this case with a good deal of pride, I am frank
to say that he is in no way indebted to me especially
for his rise in the world, but only to his natural
ability as a business man and his own personal efforts
and energy.</p>

<p>Among the many young men that I took into my
business, first and last, and taught and trained them
in business, I recall one case, especially, that of
James Summers, who came to me, among a number
of young men, then going to school at the Rusk Masonic
Institute, and begged me to teach him business.
Most of the young men, immediately after the
close of the war, thought that the mercantile business
would be about the easiest and most pleasant
to engage in, hence these many applications, among
whom I would mention ex-Governor James Hogg,
who was then a boy of about eighteen or twenty,
going to school. I recall my answer to him: “Now,
Jim, if you want to be a slave all your life, get
behind this counter and go to work, but if you will
take my advice, go out on a farm, develop your
muscles and make a man of yourself.” He answered,
“I expect to do that, Mr. Graber. I am going to
make a man of myself,” which he certainly did, but
not in mercantile pursuits.</p>

<p>To give the reader a better appreciation of the
character of James E. Summers: When he came
and asked me to teach him business his father was
the keeper of a saloon and a horse racer, and I had
understood, had whipped Jim at one time to make
him ride a horse race for him; besides the old man
was very profane and his conduct as stated. Jim’s
nature and disposition revolted at it, though Jim had
a noble Christian mother, whose disposition he, no
doubt, inherited by nature, which, in connection
with her teachings, made him the grand character
that he proved to be.</p>

<p>Although I did not need any assistance at the
time he asked for a position, which was about 1870,
I decided to take hold of him and teach him all I
knew about business, which proved a great pleasure
to me, because he was always ready to receive instruction
and profit by my advice. I soon made a
bookkeeper out of him and I am prepared to say
that I was rewarded for any salary I paid him and
any time devoted to his instruction through his great
success as a business man and his full appreciation
of my efforts in his behalf, the knowledge of which
I gained through several mutual friends, whom he
told that he was indebted to Mr. Graber for what
he was and everything he had.</p>

<p>After removing to Waxahachie, Jim married a
daughter of a Doctor Francis, who could not bear
the separation from her mother and family and,
therefore, I advised him to go back to Rusk and get
some of his farmer friends, of whom he had many,
to advance him means to go into business for himself.
This he did, and as soon as started, having
the confidence and good will of all the people in
Cherokee County, he soon did the leading business
in the place and died about ten years ago, mourned
by all that knew him, leaving an estate worth over
one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, which was
most extraordinary, considering the character of the
town of Rusk and country surrounding it.</p>

<p>Having said this much in connection with my
business career, I deem it unnecessary to enter into
further details, as it would no doubt, prove irksome
to the reader and I merely said as much to show
that I always felt interested in worthy characters
that I had associated with me in business, never
caring much for a great accumulation of wealth,
until it was too late.</p>

<p>Had I made the accumulation of money my main
object, I no doubt could have been among the rich
men of Dallas, the most of whom accumulated their
fortunes in speculative channels. Had I engaged in
speculative channels in real estate, I would certainly
have made money and had the good judgment to
quit before it was too late, wherein many of my
friends and acquaintances failed.</p>

<p>My business always outgrew the amount of my
capital and as a result I always owed the banks and
other creditors and it was a fixed principle with me
as long as I owed a dollar, that nothing I had really
belonged to me and therefore I had no moral right
to take money out of my business to put into speculative
channels in real estate.</p>

<p>Before closing my business record in Dallas, I
must pay a deserved tribute to L. Rector Cabell, who
entered my service to study and learn machinery. I
am able to say, although young and without business
experience, he soon proved himself efficient
in cotton gin machinery, and one of the most loyal
and honest men in my employ, carefully guarding
my business interests—just like his honored father,
General W. L. Cabell, and devoted sister, Mrs. Kate
Cabell Muse, in behalf of the U. C. V. organization.
After leaving my service, Rector accepted a position
with the engineering department in Havana, Cuba,
where he has been engaged since, and is now receiving
a handsome salary.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXXV<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>The Confederate Veterans’ Home.</span></h2></div>

<p>In connection with my personal history I will
take the liberty of referring to my connection with
the organization and work in behalf of the United
Confederate Veterans’ Association.</p>

<p>I realized that only by a combined effort of the
old soldiers could we perpetuate our true history
and especially take care of the indigent and needy
old comrades, when sick and in distress. While associated
with the Keating house, the Confederate
Home at Austin was started by John B. Hood Camp
of Austin and maintained by soliciting public contributions,
as the State was prohibited by the Constitution
to contribute anything towards its maintenance.
Realizing the necessity of everybody interested
doing all they were able to do and my own
ability at the time being very limited, I conceived
the plan of requesting donations by factories, whose
machinery we were handling, of certain machines
they were manufacturing as parts of a complete
cotton gin outfit. In line with this I wrote a letter
to each one of our factories, setting forth the condition
of our Confederate Home and asking contributions
of such parts as they manufactured, for
a complete 3-60 saw gin outfit. These factories were
all located in the North and East, but their response
was prompt and cheerful. I had a sixty-horse
power boiler, contributed by the Erie City
Iron Works; a 3-60 saw gins and elevator by the
Eagle Cotton Gin Company of Bridgewater, Mass.;
a Thomas steam cylinder press by the Thomas Manufacturing
Company of Little Rock, Ark., and Mr.
Keating gave me a fifty-horse power Erie City Iron
Works engine; a four-ton Chicago scale, by the
Chicago Scale Company and a magnificent Schuttler
wagon by the Peter Schuttler Wagon Company of
Chicago, the whole worth about thirty-five hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>I immediately notified Governor Ross of this
handsome donation by Northern factories, giving
him a full list of the donors, and he wrote a personal
letter of thanks to each of the parties.</p>

<p>Cotton gin machinery, at this time, was rarely
bought for cash, always sold on long time credit,
which of course did not meet the urgent needs of
the Confederate Home. In conferring with General
Cabell and other prominent members of the Camp,
we decided on a plan of having a drawing for this
machinery, selling tickets at one dollar, believing we
could raise a large amount of money in this way,
as outside of a chance of drawing the machinery was
the further inducement that the dollar paid for the
ticket would afford relief to our needy Confederate
Home. I then went to work actively, after first conferring
with some of the best legal talent of the city,
as to whether such a drawing was permissable by
law. As it was by them held entirely within the law,
taking the position that a drawing for charity was
not a lottery, but a drawing for profit is a lottery,
I had no hesitancy in permitting my name used in
connection with it.</p>

<p>About this time we had an exciting contest for
the Governorship of the State between Attorney
General Hogg and Judge George Clark of Waco. On
the policies of each, our comrades of the Camp were
divided. While our Confederate Constitution prohibits
the discussion of politics in the meetings of
our Camp, still the members were not prohibited
from expressing their views outside. The Clark element
of the Camp insisted before we proceeded in
this drawing to write Attorney General Hogg, asking
his opinion on the legal status of such proceedings,
hoping that he would rule adversely, thereby
making himself very unpopular in the State. Knowing
Hogg’s disposition on such ruling and believing
he would express a radical view on the same, I did
my best to keep the matter from reaching his ears,
but all to no purpose.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention I had gone on with the work
of getting up tickets and an attractive circular with
large cuts of each machine, and sent them broadcast
all over the State. I sent a hundred tickets
each to the sheriff and county clerk of each county,
requesting them to act as sales agents for us, when
we had numerous letters from different ones, saying
that they could sell every ticket they had and to
send more, thus we had a fair prospect of raising
at least fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The continued agitation by members of the Camp
on the subject, asking Attorney General Hogg for
his opinion, resulted in my being appointed a committee
of one to write to him for his opinion in the
matter, when he answered promptly in response that
such proceedings would be illegal and he hoped that
it would not be attempted. When I read his letter
to the Camp the Clark men said they had always
been satisfied that his ruling would be such and insisted
on dropping the matter. Having cherished
the hope that I would be instrumental in perhaps
securing the magnificent sum of fifty thousand dollars
for the benefit of the Confederate Home, which
in connection with the opinion of several of the
ablest lawyers in the State—such men as the Hon.
Seth Sheppard and others, whose names I don’t remember
and whose opinions I regarded more highly
than I did Hogg’s, as their construction of the law
in the matter, as before stated, seemed to me most
reasonable and fair—I told the members of the
Camp, “The drawing goes on. My name is on the
ticket and if Attorney General Hogg wants to proceed
in the matter, he is at liberty to proceed against
me.”</p>

<p>The Sunday following I wrote a personal letter
to my old-time friend, Attorney General Hogg, setting
forth the urgency of our action and finally told
him, by my advice the Camp had decided to go on
with the drawing and the object of my writing him
was simply to say that we valued his opinion most
highly and appreciated his good intentions towards
the Confederate Home and his rulings were fully in
accord with his duties, as he conceived them to be,
and finally wound up the letter by saying, “the end
justified the means,” which expression proved fatal
and got him stirred up about the matter to the extent,
as I suspected, of notifying all sheriffs and
county clerks that it would be dangerous for them
to undertake the sale of the tickets and as a result,
I regret to have to record that all the tickets were
returned to me, except perhaps about a hundred.</p>

<p>In answer to my letter the Attorney General
stated that if we persisted in having the drawing
that he would use all the power of the State at his
command to put it down and punish us.</p>

<p>The Clark men of the Camp soon circulated the
result of our correspondence and proclaimed to the
State that Attorney General Hogg was unfriendly
to the Confederate Home and also to our Confederate
organization, which of course he denied in
several of his speeches.</p>

<p>Every Governor up until now, preceding his elevation
to the office, had been an ex-Confederate soldier,
but had never done anything to assist in the
maintenance of the Confederate Home through any
appropriation of the State’s money.</p>

<p>As is well known, Governor Hogg was elected
and soon after his installation into the office, he
caused the appropriation of money collected from
rental of a building that had been temporarily used
as the Capitol, while the new Capitol Building was
under construction and immediately after the assembling
of the Legislature, urged the passage of
a resolution, submitting a Constitutional Amendment
to enable the State to take charge of the Confederate
Home and also to give pensions to needy
Confederates, not in the Home.</p>

<p>It is needless to say when this amendment was
voted on by the people of the State it was carried by
a large majority, thus enabling legislative appropriations
for its maintenance in a suitable manner.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXXVI<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>My Appointments in the U. C. V.</span></h2></div>

<p>On the organization of the U. C. V. in 1892, I
received the appointment by Lieutenant-General
Cabell, who was elected Commander of the Trans-Mississippi
Department, of Quartermaster-General
of the Trans-Mississippi Department, with the rank
of Brigadier-General. On receipt of my commission,
issued by General John B. Gordon, one morning,
while opening the package, Mr. C. A. Keating
was looking on and on my being surprised at such
promotion, never having had notice of General Cabell’s
appointment, Keating asked me what I was
going to do about it? I told him that I was going
to turn it down, that I did not think I deserved any
such promotion, besides I feared it would take a
great deal of my valuable time out of business, when
he insisted on my accepting it, which I still refused.
He made me promise to take the document home
to my children, saying that they had more interest
perhaps, in such an honor than I had and if they
were willing to have me turn it down he would have
nothing further to say. In connection with this, he
asked a question, “Tell me of a Confederate soldier
in this community that has done as much for the
needy Confederates as you have and is more entitled
to it than you are?”</p>

<p>I took the document home, as I had promised
him, to show to my children and when I suggested to
them that I intended to turn it down they would not
hear to it, saying that they were as much interested
in the matter and would appreciate it as a great
honor conferred on them, as well as myself, when
I finally had to yield in the matter and accepted
the appointment, which I have never had cause to
regret, though it was a heavy tax on my purse and
time, which latter properly belonged to C. A. Keating,
to say nothing of using his stenographer, etc.,
all of which he cheerfully contributed and is entitled
to the credit.</p>

<p>Having served in this capacity for a number of
years, I was finally elected to the command of the
Fourth Brigade, composed of the principal Camps
of North Texas, with a membership of about five
thousand, which forced me to resign the office of
Quartermaster General and accept the high honor,
which I very much appreciated. Serving in this capacity
a year, I decided to decline re-election on account
of deficiency in hearing, which almost disqualified
me from presiding over this body at its
annual meeting and soon after, was appointed by
General Stephen D. Lee, Assistant Adjutant-General
on his staff, with the rank of Brigadier-General
and which appointment I have had from every successive
commander and I may, perhaps, hold until
death. I certainly appreciate these honors conferred
on me by my Confederate comrades, more
perhaps than anything that has ever fallen to my
lot. This closes my connection with the Confederate
U. C. V. organization; many of the details of its
works I do not care to record herein, as they might
appear too much of egotism.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir: I have yours of April 18, with enclosures.
I had seen the pleasant incidents of return
of flags by veterans of Texas, and also the return
of the Ranger flag at time it occurred. Let us hope
your letter to the President did good, for certainly
he has changed his views, and if he has not recanted
what he once wrote and spoke, he has for some time
spoken and acted in the very opposite way, which
virtually is the same thing. This is the country of
our fathers, of us all now and of our children, and
we should accept any advances of reconciliation and
obliteration of sectional lines possible and consistent
with our self-respect.</p>

<p>Thanking you for your letter and enclosure,
I return them,</p>

<p>With kind wishes,</p>

<p>Dear General: I have much pleasure in handing
you herein a copy of S/O No. 12, naming the staff
of the Commander-in-Chief of the U. C. V.</p>

<p>The General Commanding this glorious Federation
feels that the responsibility rests on him to use
every effort to bring forth the results that will be
for its best interests. He knows that if the earnest
workers and progressive spirits in the association
will render such services in his aid as he has reason
to think they will, our order will make more rapid
advances in the future, greatly diminished as are our
numbers, than in the past.</p>

<p>Trusting, then, on your love for the organization
and your eminent fitness for the position, he has
selected you as one of his personal staff; and begs
that you will honor him by accepting the position
of Assistant Adjutant-General, with the rank of
Brigadier-General.</p>

<p>In addition to using every occasion to increase
the interest and affection of the veterans in our “social,
literary, historical and benevolent” society, and
constantly working to bring about peace and harmony
among the comrades, he particularly desires
that you will, if possible, be in attendance at the
Memphis Reunion, in full dress uniform, and meet
him at the Headquarters Hotel (the Peabody Hotel)
to concert measures that will make this a most memorable
occasion. He hopes that you will attend the
daily sessions of the convention, be present on the
stage with him, and on the day of the parade take
part with the entire staff in full uniform.</p>

<p>Trusting that you may be able and willing to
assist in this great work in the way indicated, with
every good wish for your health, prosperity and
happiness,</p>

<p>My Dear Sir: I highly appreciated and greatly
enjoyed reading your good letter of the 12th instant,
and its inclosures, one of which is herewith returned.
Needless for me to say to you that I am in heartiest
sympathy with the generous, patriotic and American
sentiments so well expressed in the “Concurrent
Resolution” of the two Houses of the Indiana Legislature,
Session of 1899. Ten years earlier, in 1889, in
an address to the veterans of my regiment (24th
Iowa Infantry) in reunion assembled, I said, in part:</p>

<p>“In forming the characters and shaping the
lives of the future citizens of this great Republic,
we fondly hope that the unselfish devotion to duty
and the unshaken valor of the volunteer soldier will
be a potent influence for good; that his heroism will
live in song and story and through all the years to
come, be a challenge to patriotism, above the din of
party strife ringing loud and clear as bugles that
blow for battle. Nor do we forget that our late foes
were brave men and gallant soldiers. Their valor,
like the valor of the men of the North, illustrates
and adorns the character of the American citizen soldier.
This character, tempered and proved in the
crucible of battle, is the pledge and sure prophecy
of the greatness of our common country. Looking
into the future, may we not say of the coming American
citizen, ‘His shall be larger manhood’ because
of the heroic example of the men who conquered
with Grant and Sherman and the no less heroic example
of the men who surrendered with Lee and
Johnston. Of this coming American, may we not
predict that, where need is, he will know that ‘not
suffering but faint heart is worst of woes.’ In the
nobler destiny of our country, in the larger and
stronger character of its people, will be found the
final compensation for all the suffering and all the
losses of the war.”</p>

<p>Please keep me closely informed in regard to the
prospects for the greatly desired Texas appropriation
for the Vicksburg Park. Command and direct
me whenever I can help in any way.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>Very cordially yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>WM. T. RIGBY, Chairman.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXXVII<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>The Terry Rangers’ Flag.</span></h2></div>

<p>One most remarkable incident I must not fail to
add: As stated heretofore, the Terry Rangers of
which I was a member, lost a beautiful flag sent
us by a couple of young ladies of Nashville, made
of their dresses, which after the first engagement
wherein it was displayed, near Rome, Georgia, we
lost in a stampede and it was found by a scout of
the enemy the next day. This flag had worked in
beautiful silk letters, the name of Terry’s Texas
Rangers, beside some Latin, which I do not remember.
After the war, on a number of public occasions,
such as the several National Expositions in Chicago
and Philadelphia, the Grand Army, who had charge
of such matters, exhibited this flag, with a tag in
bold letters, “Captured from Terry’s Texas Rangers
in an engagement near Rome, Georgia, by the
Seventeenth Indiana Mounted Infantry.”</p>

<p>Such a public exhibition of our misfortune was
galling to the members of the regiment and when
Governor Hendricks, the first Democratic Governor
of Indiana, was installed, we made a request through
our Governor Hubbard for the return of the flag.
Governor Hendricks very properly referred the request
to the State Librarian of Indiana, who happened
to be a vindictive, howling Republican and
in answer wrote Governor Hubbard a very insulting
letter, refusing to return the flag. The matter then
was dropped.</p>

<p>About thirty-four years after the close of the
war, a business friend, Mr. William Burr of Dallas,
who was an ex-Federal soldier, came to my office one
day, and asked me if I ever drank any cider? I told
him I did when I could get good cider. He told me
he had a friend in an old shack near the Windsor
Hotel, who was making cider, and invited me to go
around and have a glass of cider with him. To this
I consented. He there introduced me to a Major
Weiler, and in conversation with him, I found that
he belonged to Wilder’s Brigade, who were with
Sherman’s army in Georgia. While we were sipping
cider Burr remarked, “Well, this is pretty good;
two Yanks and one Johnny sipping cider together.”
Major Weiler then asked what command I belonged
to? I told him I belonged to the Eighth Texas Cavalry.
He said, “Terry’s Texas Rangers?” I told
him, “Yes,” when he said, “I am mighty glad to
meet you; I have been trying to find somebody belonging
to your command ever since I’ve been in Dallas.
I am the man that found your flag.” Of course,
I was much gratified at meeting him and told him
about our efforts to have the flag returned and the
result at the hands of the State Librarian. “Now,
Major, this flag is yours; you found it and as you
state you want to return it, you make a demand on
Governor Mount of Indiana, claiming the flag as
yours and return it to our regiment.” He said that
it had been the ambition of his life to do this and in
accordance therewith indited a letter to Governor
Mount, requesting the return of the flag to him, for
the purpose, he stated, to return it to the Rangers.</p>

<p>He furthermore stated that he was well acquainted
with Governor Mount, as the Governor was a
private in his command, of which he was a major.
Verily, strange are the vicissitudes of life! Governor
Mount’s major was now making cider at five cents
a glass.</p>

<p>In due time Major Weiler received an answer
to his request from the Governor’s Private Secretary,
stating that the Governor had no authority to
return the flag, which could only be done through
a joint resolution of the Legislature of Indiana. We
then both concluded that we might as well give it
up; we hardly thought that a unanimous vote could
be had on such a proposition by a lot of politicians.</p>

<p>I then requested the major to furnish me a written
statement, setting forth the circumstances under
which he came into possession of the flag and especially
that the flag was not captured in battle, but
was picked up in the road the next day after our
engagement, encased in a rubber pocket, and he did
not examine it until he returned from a scout and
rejoined his main command, being much surprised
that the package found contained the Terry Texas
Rangers’ flag, which was forwarded to the State authorities
at Indianapolis, Indiana.</p>

<p>In about a month the Terry Rangers had their
annual reunion at Austin, Texas, where I had read
the statement of Major Weiler, which, of course,
was a matter of surprise and deep interest. A resolution
by a comrade was offered to appoint a committee,
with myself as chairman, to memorialize the
Indiana Legislature, requesting the return of the
flag, I being the only member of the committee
present, the balance not being in attendance at the
reunion. On my return home I wrote to each member
of the committee, requesting them to draw up a
memorial and forward to me, to which I received no
response. I then drew up the memorial myself and
attached a letter I received from a Colonel Wylie in
Dallas, who was a gallant soldier and commanded
an Iowa regiment during the war.</p>

<p>I next forwarded this memorial to the Richmond
City Mill Works of Richmond, Indiana, a concern
I was doing business with, requesting that they turn
it over to their Representative in the Legislature,
which they promptly did and in due time I received
a letter from Senator Binkley, stating that he would
take pleasure in introducing it and that I would
hear from him in due time.</p>

<p>To my great surprise, in about thirty days I received
a printed copy of a joint resolution of the
Legislature of the State of Indiana, carried unanimously,
instructing Governor Mount to return the
flag to the Terry’s Texas Rangers in person and appropriating
two hundred and fifty dollars to pay
the expense of his trip to Texas. The complete resolution
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>Preamble and Concurrent Resolution in relation
to the return to the association of the survivors of
Terry’s Texas Rangers of their battle flag, captured
from them during the late war of rebellion by the
17th Regiment of Indiana Infantry (mounted) Volunteers,
appointing a commission to discharge said
duty, and ordering an appropriation to pay the expenses
thereof.</p>

<p>Whereas, On October 13, 1864, during the War of
the Rebellion, the flag of the Texas Rangers at a
battle near Coosaville, Alabama, was captured by
the 17th Regiment of Indiana Infantry (mounted)
Volunteers, in command of Major J. J. Weiler, and
then belonging to General J. T. Wilder’s Brigade,
which brigade at the time was in command of General
A. O. Miller, and subsequently, by the proper
authorities, was deposited in the archives of the
State of Indiana, and now reposes in the custody of
the State Geologist, and to which is attached the
following inscription:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Battle flag of the Texas Rangers, captured
from the 8th Texas Cavalry near Galesville, Alabama,
October 13, 1864, by two companies of the
17th Indiana Infantry, commanded by Major J. J.
Weiler, of Company E, Wilder’s Brigade.”</p>

</div>

<p>And, Whereas, H. W. Graber, George W. Littlefield,
S. P. Christian, W. D. Cleveland and R. Y.
King, all of the State of Texas, as a committee duly
appointed by and representing the Association of
Survivors of Terry’s Texas Rangers, by their petition
hereunto attached, have asked the Legislature
of the State of Indiana to kindly return to that association
said battle flag, that it may be kept and
treasured by them, and in said memorial the said
Major J. J. Weiler, now a Past Commander of the
Grand Army of the Republic for the district of Texas,
has united, and which memorial is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“To the Honorable President of the Senate and
Speaker of the House of Representatives of the
Legislature of the State of Indiana:</p>

<p>“The undersigned, your memorialists, most respectfully
show that they were selected by the Association
of Survivors of Terry’s Texas Rangers, a
committee to memorialize your honorable bodies for
the return to said association of the colors of that
command, lost during the Civil War near Coosaville,
Alabama.</p>

<p>“Your memorialists would show that in a cavalry
engagement on the 13th day of October, 1864,
the flag of the Texas Rangers was lost near the field
and found by one of your memorialists, Mr. J. J.
Weiler, then the Major of the 17th Indiana Infantry,
and was subsequently deposited in the archives of
your State.</p>

<p>“In view of the fact that the American people
have forever put behind them the animosities and
heartburnings which were incident to our unfortunate
Civil War, and are one united, patriotic people,
marching shoulder to shoulder under the folds
of the Star Spangled Banner, and keeping the step
to ‘Hail Columbia’ in the onward sweep to that high
destiny, which, through the providence of God,
awaits our grand Republic.</p>

<p>“Your memorialists would most respectfully request
that such action be taken by your honorable
bodies as will result in the return of the flag to the
Association of the Survivors of Terry’s Rangers.</p>

<p>“As beautifully and appropriately expressed by
Col. W. D. Wylie, in his letter hereto attached, ‘We
now drink out of the same canteen, sheltered and
protected by one common flag,’ a sentiment so universal
that it is without hesitation we appeal to our
countrymen, the brave and gallant and patriotic citizens
of Indiana, in even a matter of sentiment so
delicate as that involved in our request. And as
gracious as the favor will be accounted by the association,
we are sure that the still greater pleasure
will be with the people of Indiana in bestowing it.</p>

follows:</p>
<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>“Dallas, Texas, September 30, 1898.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Col. H. W. Graber, Quartermaster-General Trans-Mississippi Department, U. C. V.:</p>

<p>“My Dear Sir: Referring to the conversation
we had in reference to the colors of your old command,
which had been lost during the late Civil War,
on October 13, 1864, in a battle near Coosaville, Ala.,
by my comrade and our mutual friend, Maj. J. J.
Weiler, of the 17th Indiana, who had, under instructions,
turned the flag over to the State of Indiana,
where it now reposes in the State library at Indianapolis,
and which you are now endeavoring to
have returned to the remnant of your old command—as
an old soldier, Colonel, I can readily understand
the beautiful sentiment which is so characteristic
of the American soldier in the desire of yourself
and comrades to secure the colors under which
you passed through so many dangers, which are now
passed and gone, leaving only the memories of a
struggle which has resulted, with all its sufferings
and animosities, in bringing us closer together, and
we now drink out of the same canteen, sheltered and
protected by one common flag, and in this connection,
at your request, it is with pleasure I give the
episode relating to the return of the flag of the 57th
Indiana Infantry by Texas, in 1885. While commanding
the Department of Texas, Grand Army of the
Republic, in 1885, Parsons’ Confederate Brigade
held their annual reunion at Cleburne, Texas. Myself
and others who wore the blue were the honored
guests of the brigade. During the proceedings,
Major Heath and Capt. W. G. Veal called my attention
to the fact that a brave soldier (a corporal) of
the 13th Tennessee, now a resident and citizen of
Texas, had in his possession and on the grounds the
regimental flag and colors of the 57th Indiana,
which he had captured at the Battle of Franklin,
Tenn., in December, 1864, and had taken careful
care of for twenty years, hoping that he would find
some representative of that regiment to whom he
could return this priceless and precious relic. I received
the valued colors from the brave soldier and
immediately conferred with Department Commander
of the State of Indiana, and was informed that
the 57th would hold their annual reunion during
the month of September of the current year, and
they earnestly requested that Texas be present in
person at that time for the return of their long-lost
colors. We arranged that Capt. W. G. Veal and
Maj. E. M. Heath, of the Confederate Veterans, and
Corporal W. M. Crooks, the brave soldier who had
captured the colors, should accompany myself and
staff to the reunion at Kokomo, taking with us the
flag.</p>

<p>“It is needless to give you the incidents of the trip
further than that Indiana threw her doors open to
give the old Texans who had met them on the field,
a royal reception, and Corporal Crooks was received
with open arms by the boys in blue, whom he had
last met at the point of the bayonet on the field of
battle; and the return of that precious relic that
had spread its silken folds over the brave Hoosier
boys in many a hard-fought battle, wiped out the
animosities engendered by the war, especially between
Indiana and Texas, and Corporal Crooks occupies
an enviable niche in the war history of the
Hoosier State, and the boys in blue and the boys in
gray are now marching elbow to elbow, side by side,
for the honor and integrity of our common country,
and I can assure you, Colonel, that when you make
the application for the return of your colors it will
be as much of a heartfelt pleasure for Indiana to
return the flag as for Texas to receive it.</p>

<p>As soon as it became known to the Grand Army
organization of Indiana, a certain post, numbering
about four hundred members, passed a resolution
denouncing the action of the Indiana Legislature
and demanding of Governor Mount not to return
the flag. The reporter of a paper, who attended
this meeting, on his way home met General Ryan,
the Commander of the Grand Army organization of
the State and submitted to him the resolution passed
by this post, when he unqualifiedly endorsed it
and stated that he was going to write to Governor
Mount not to return the flag.</p>

<p>Governor Mount then wrote to General Wilder,
who commanded the brigade to which Major Weiler
belonged, and asked his opinion and received General
Weiler’s answer, saying the flag ought to be
returned. Governor Mount also wrote to General
Henry, who commanded the division and had his
answer, saying the flag ought to be returned, which
Governor Mount determined to do at any cost.</p>

<p>Immediately on my receipt of the resolutions I
forwarded it to Senator Wooten in Austin and suggested
to him that this was no longer an affair of our
regiment, but it was the action of the State of Indiana
extending the olive branch to the State of
Texas and should have suitable acknowledgment.
I requested Senator Wooten to introduce a resolution
inviting the whole Legislature of the State of
Indiana to come to Texas as the guests of our Legislature
and appropriating ten thousand dollars to
defray the expense thereof. (This appropriation
was unconstitutional and could not have carried, but
as it turned out, it was not needed, as the Indiana
Legislature, on receipt of same, had already adjourned.)</p>

<p>Austin, Tex., March 4.—(Special.)—The correspondence
and concurrent resolution relating to the
return of a battle flag to the Texas Rangers are of
interest. Senator Brinkley, one of the members of
the Senate of Indiana, wrote to Mr. H. W. Graber
of Dallas. The letter from Hon. C. C. Brinkley and
the resolutions adopted by the Indiana Legislature
were printed in The News of Thursday, March 2,
while the memorial and other letters referred to in
the following have previously appeared in The
News:</p>

<p>Mr. Graber of Dallas has written to Mr. Wooten
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>Dallas, Tex., Feb. 27.—Hon. Dudley G. Wooten,
Austin, Tex.: Dear Sir—Inclosed find copies of
memorial, letter and resolution of the Legislature of
the State of Indiana, in reference to the return of
the battle flag to the Association of Survivors of
Terry’s Texas Rangers.</p>

<p>You will observe that the resolution contemplates
the return of the flag by his excellency, the Governor
of Indiana, in person, and an appropriation
is made to defray the expenses of the Governor and
party.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that this liberal, generous and
patriotic action upon the part of the Legislature
and Governor of Indiana should be met by appropriate
official recognition by the Legislature of the
State of Texas.</p>

<p>It has been suggested, and it seems to me rightful,
that the Governor of Indiana and his party,
while in the State, should be the guests of the State
of Texas, and that a small appropriation should be
made and placed at the disposal of Gov. Sayers, to
enable him in the name and on behalf of the people
of the State, to extend to Gov. Mount and party a
royal welcome to Texas. Such amenities are invaluable,
and would tend to wipe out the lingering
bitterness of the past, more closely connect the
American people in common brotherhood, and place
Texas in the true light before the world as among
the most patriotic and liberal States in the Union.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you confer with Governor
Sayers and Major Littlefield (who resides at Austin,
one of the officers of the Association of Terry’s Texas
Rangers) as to the action to be taken.</p>

<p>I assume that the time will be designated for a
meeting of the association to be held at Austin for
the purpose of meeting Gov. Mount and party. I
am sure it is not necessary to say that Texas should
not permit Indiana to outstrip her in the good work
of joyous reconciliation.</p>

<p>Please return to me the copies inclosed when
you have no further need for them, as I wish to
present them with my report to the Association.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>Yours truly,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>H. W. GRABER.</p>

</div>

<p>The following is the concurrent resolution introduced
by Judge Kittrell and passed:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>Concurrent Resolution:</p>

<p>Whereas, the Legislature of Texas has just heard
with emotions of sincerest pleasure that the Legislature
of the State of Indiana has adopted a resolution
providing for the return of the battle flag of
Terry’s Texas Rangers, which was captured by an
Indiana regiment during the late war between the
States, and has appointed a committee, including
Gov. Mount and his staff to visit Texas and return
said flag to the Association of the Survivors of Terry’s
Texas Rangers. Therefore, be it</p>

<p>Resolved, by the House of Representatives, the
Senate concurring, That the action of the Legislature
of Indiana is recognized as most generous, chivalric
and patriotic and is hailed as a most gratifying evidence
of the restoration of that unselfish and unsectional
spirit upon the existence and continuance of
which so largely depends the prosperity and happiness
of our common country, and that the thanks of
the Legislature of Texas be and are hereby tendered
the Legislature of our sister State of Indiana for its
patriotic action. And be it further</p>

<p>Resolved, That the committee appointed by the
Legislature of Indiana to return said flag be and it
is hereby invited to visit the city of Austin at the
earliest possible day to the end that appropriate
ceremonies may mark the occasion of the return of
said flag, for which ceremonies the use of the hall
of the House of Representatives is hereby tendered.
Be it further</p>

<p>Resolved, That an invitation to attend said ceremonies
be and is hereby extended to the Governor
and other State officers and the Legislature of Indiana
and to the Governor and other State officers
of Texas, to the Association of the Survivors of
Terry’s Texas Rangers, John B. Hood Camp, Austin
Camp of the Grand Army of the Republic and the
inmates of the Confederate Home. Be it further</p>

<p>Resolved, That these resolutions be at once transmitted
by wire to the Governor of Indiana with the
request that he lay them at once before the Senate
and House of Representatives of that State and a
duly engrossed copy thereof, signed by the Speaker
of the House and the President of the Senate and
duly attested by the Clerk of the House and Secretary
of the Senate be likewise transmitted by mail
to both the Speaker of the House of Representatives
and President of the Senate of the State of Indiana.</p>

</div>

<p>Governor Mount was taken sick very soon after
and was unable to come to Texas immediately, but
in a further correspondence with him, asked to have
the time of his visit deferred until fall, which
suited our purpose exactly. Colonel Wylie, in the
meantime, received a newspaper clipping, containing
the action of the army post, endorsed by General
Ryan, demanding that the flag be not returned,
when we both agreed we would keep the matter
secret, which we did. There is no doubt it would
have marred the pleasure of the Governor’s visit
had any mention been made to him of the matter.</p>

<p>After my comrades of the committee learned I
had been successful in having the flag returned,
Mr. W. D. Cleveland of Houston insisted that the
meeting on the return of the flag should be had in
his city. Mr. Littlefield claimed it ought to be at
Austin and so on, but I finally decided that it ought
to be at Dallas during our State Fair, when we had
low railroad rates and greater crowds than they
could gather at any point in Texas. I then submitted
the matter to Governor Mount and had his
letter, expressing himself highly pleased, as he would
thus be enabled to see more of Texas than he would
at any other time, having heard a great deal about
the extent of our State Fair. He furthermore stated
in this letter that when he came to Texas he would
come in state, as the representative of the State of
Indiana.</p>

<p>During the first week of the fair we had the
pleasure of the arrival of the Governor and his magnificent
staff, which latter were in brilliant uniform
and proved to be one of the most magnificent bodies
of men we ever had to visit Dallas. They also
brought their horse equipment, such as saddles,
bridles, etc., and were accompanied by quite a number
of ladies; if I remember correctly, there were
fifty-two in the party, on a special train, and with
the party was our friend, General Ryan, to whom
the Governor had turned over the two hundred and
fifty dollars appropriated for him to pay his expenses.</p>

<p>I regret to have to record that I was unable to
secure the attendance of a large part of our Ranger
organization, who seemed to have taken offense because
we had the meeting at Dallas, really prompted
by petty jealousies of the cities where they resided
and, as a consequence, we had only twenty-four
Rangers present.</p>

<p>The meeting of the Governors and the ceremonies
attending the occasion, was had in the Machinery
Hall at the Fair Grounds, which had a seating capacity,
outside of the stage, of only about one thousand
to twelve hundred. At the hour of the opening
of the ceremonies the Indiana Governor, with his
staff and ladies, were seated on one side of the
stage with twenty-four vacant chairs in two rows,
in front, on the opposite side of the stage and the
rear portion of the stage, occupied by the city officials
and prominent citizens of the town, the two
Governors sitting together in the front part of the
aisle.</p>

<p>When everything was ready I marched in the
twenty-four Rangers present in column, by twos,
headed by myself with Miss Ruth Phelps, carrying
a Texas flag. Miss Ruth Phelps was the daughter
of one of our Rangers and the only member of the
Phelps family living and was lost in the Galveston
storm the next year.</p>

<p>After forming the Rangers in two lines in front
of their chairs, I introduced Governor Mount to
everyone and he, in turn, introduced General Ryan
and when General Ryan had reached and shaken
hands with the last member on the second row, he
came around in front, singing, “There is a land
that is fairer than day,” in which the whole audience
joined, standing, and I believe proved one of
the most affecting scenes ever witnessed in this
city. We then had several speeches before the Governor
spoke, one by General Ryan, which evidenced
considerable change in his attitude on the return of
the flag and which, of course, was unknown to any
one present, except Colonel Wylie and myself.</p>

<p>In the course of Senator Brinkley’s remarks he
referred to the captured flag, when one of our
Rangers jumped up, asking pardon for interrupting
him, and saying he wanted the audience to understand
that the flag was not captured, but it was
found, when another one of our Rangers remarked:
“Bill, you know they run us out of it; what’s the
difference?” which, of course, created considerable
merriment. Governor Mount happened to be sitting
near me and remarked, “Graber, I thought you
Rangers never run,” when I said to him, “Governor,
if they hadn’t run a thousand times, there would not
have been one left here to tell the tale. We always
knew when to quit and didn’t require a bugle call
to bring us out.”</p>

<p>Governor Mount next made one of the most patriotic
speeches, characteristic of the man, ever listened
to, which was responded to by Governor Sayers,
who also, it is needless to say, did full justice
to the occasion, as he, too, had been a gallant Confederate
soldier.</p>

<p>After the closing of the speeches Governor Mount
had the flag brought forward on the stage and, with
a few appropriate remarks, handed it over to Governor
Sayers, who also accepted it with appropriate
remarks. Thus ended one of the grandest occasions
ever had since the Civil War and its salutary effect
on sectional feeling cannot be overestimated.</p>

<p>The Governor and staff remained with us three
days. We had the best rooms at the Oriental Hotel
assigned them and their hotel bills were paid by
Camp Sterling Price, the Grand Army Post of Dallas
and the Fair Association, and taking their expression
on their visit, they left impressed with the
grandeur of the Lone Star State and its people.
Governor Mount and several members of his staff,
among whom was Major Durban, who succeeded
Governor Mount in the office of Governor, made me
promise if I ever came anywhere near Indianapolis
I must be sure to stop, as they wanted an opportunity
to entertain me and I regret to have to report
that I, on a business trip in that section, made a
special visit to Indianapolis to meet them once more,
when I found Governor Mount’s body prepared for
burial. This changed my trip from that of pleasure
to one of sadness and regret, and with this feeling,
I did not stop, but passed through without making
myself known.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span><h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>Roosevelt’s Visit to Texas</span></h2></div>

<p>A few years after this incident Dallas was making
great preparations to receive and entertain President
Roosevelt, on an invitation extended him by
Colonel John N. Simpson of the National Exchange
Bank.</p>

<p>Colonel Simpson and Roosevelt were neighbors,
on adjoining ranches in the great Northwest and
were great friends. When Colonel Roosevelt raised
his regiment of Rough Riders at San Antonio, Colonel
Simpson’s son, Sloan Simpson, quit Harvard College
and joined the regiment at San Antonio and
was with his regiment in their engagement at San
Juan Hill, which furthermore increased their friendship.</p>

<p>In April of that year I received a Congressional
pamphlet containing a speech of Congressman
Kitchin of North Carolina, scoring President Roosevelt
on many of his expressions and acts while in
office. This was just preceding his second nomination
for the Presidency. We had had some bitter
denunciations of the President by Senator Vardaman
of Mississippi and Tillman of South Carolina,
and after reading the speech of Kitchin, in which
he referred to Roosevelt’s book on the life of Benton,
which had the largest circulation of any he ever
published and in which occurs the expression,
“Through the Southern character runs a streak of
coarse brutality,” and another passage, “As long as
the word treason is in the English dictionary, so long
will Jefferson Davis stand the Archtraitor of this
country,” and again Kitchin said, “Would I startle
this House to call attention to a speech delivered by
this man, the President of this great country, in the
Capital City of the Nation, denouncing the Confederate
soldier as an anarchist!”</p>

<p>In connection with this I would state that President
Roosevelt’s mother was a Southern woman,
born and raised in Georgia, sister of ex-Governor
Bullock. How could he reconcile such an expression
as his first; certainly it was a strange expression
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Pondering over the situation frequently, I came
to the conclusion that this speech of Kitchin’s had
been sent broadcast over the State and if so, we had
a thousand Vardamans in Texas that would be sure
to make his visit to Texas unpleasant and might result
in his being insulted, which of course, would
place Texas in a very unenviable position with the
people of the North and East. I finally concluded
to write Mr. Roosevelt a letter, calling attention to
Kitchin’s speech and quoting the above remarks
from this speech and suggesting his correction of his
position on these matters, before he made his visit
to Texas. In my letter I especially referred to the
Indiana flag incident, enclosing copies of the affair,
which I requested returned.</p>

<p class='noindent'>To the Hon. Theodore Roosevelt,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>President of the United States,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:5em;'>Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir: I have read with deep interest your
recent expressions in response to invitations from
Southern communities indicating an earnest desire
to bring about a better understanding, and forever
obliterate the last vestige of sectional feeling resulting
from the unfortunate conflict of forty years ago;
particularly, your letter accepting an invitation
from the Confederate Camp at Paris, Texas, which
induces me to offer a few suggestions, and more fully
inform you of the position of the Confederate soldier
today, who I know is as solicitous of this country’s
future as you possibly can be, and on which I
feel assured, you require no further evidence than
he has furnished both in private and public life
particularly, in his country’s hour of peril incident
on foreign war.</p>

<p>Camp Sterling Price of this city—the largest
camp in our Confederate organization—immediately
on receipt of your patriotic expressions extending
the olive branch to the solid South, in which you
rose superior to party limitation, originated a resolution
inviting you to become the guest of our camp
when on your visit to Texas. This resolution was
drawn and introduced by a gallant comrade—who
has since passed over the River—and supported with
one of the most eloquent and patriotic appeals
ever delivered in our Camp’s meeting, but opposed
by me, because of your former expressions on the
character of Southern people, and particularly, on
the Confederate soldier, which forbid such action
until you could correct statements so damaging to
our character, so degrading in the estimation of our
children and in the eyes of the civilized world, thereby
reviving and strengthening the unjust prejudice
of a large class of Northern people.</p>

<p>These, your expressions referred to, I find in a
speech of the Hon. Claud Kitchen of North Carolina,
delivered in Congress on the 23rd of April last, as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, your party and your section
might have expected great things and good treatment
at the hands of Mr. Roosevelt, but we of the
South could not. We knew that twenty-five years
after Lee surrendered this gentleman, in two of his
public volumes, had denounced Jefferson Davis as
an Arch traitor, and had declared that until out of
the dictionary had been stricken the word ‘Treason’
Jefferson Davis was a traitor. We felt then, and
we feel now, that that was a strike across the memory
of the idolized dead, at the whole South and the
Confederate soldiers. We knew, too, that in one of
his volumes—the Life of Benton—perhaps the most
widely read work of which he is author, he declared
that ‘through the Southern character there
ran a streak of coarse and brutal barbarism.’ We
could expect little from him. Would I startle this
house to remind it that after the passing of nearly
forty years from Appomattox, Mr. Roosevelt, President
of the United States and of a united people,
stood here in the Capital City of our Nation and
proclaimed to the world that the Confederate soldier
was an anarchist? So surprising was this utterance,
so revolting was it, that the Washington Post,
a loyal supporter of Mr. Roosevelt’s Administration,
was led to observe, editorially: ‘It is disagreeable
enough to the Southern people to be officially designated
as Rebels, and now to add anarchist is an
exasperation which we find it impossible to believe
the President really intended.’ These words from
the lips of a President, and at the National capital,
while yet the grave at Canton was wet with the tears
of Southern grief!”</p>

</div>

<p>It is needless to say that these expressions were
not known to the members of the Confederate Camp
who extended you these invitations, but no doubt
will become known before you visit the State, and
when so known will prove embarrassing to all concerned.
This must, and can be avoided, simply by
a correction on your part, a withdrawal of your
terrible arraignment of the people of the South, and
particularly, the Confederate soldier.</p>

<p>Please understand, the organization I have the
honor to represent, as Commander of the Fourth
Texas Brigade, United Confederate Veterans, which
numbers eighty-nine Camps, the Paris Camp among
them, and a membership of about five thousand, is
especially charged with the preservation of the truth
of history, and the protection of the Confederate
character. Northern historians are still branding
the Confederate soldier a traitor; what will be the
effect on the minds of our children, nay, the entire
country, to have Confederates paying homage to
one who has even gone a step further, and denounced
the Confederate soldier as anarchist? Consider,
Mr. President, the lofty character of Robert
E. Lee; General Robert E. Lee branded an anarchist
by the President of this great Nation! The same
sense of duty and sublime patriotism that prompted
Lee to take up arms in defense of principle and country,
prompted every true Confederate soldier in the
ranks.</p>

<p>I do not deem it necessary to enter into a further
presentation of the unfortunate attitude you occupy
toward the people of the South and the Confederate
soldier until a correction is made—which it is in
your power now to do, and I am persuaded to believe,
as a fearless, brave and honorable man you
will not hesitate to do, and by this act of simple
justice accomplish more towards a complete conciliation
of all sections than anything else done.</p>

<p>To impress on you more fully the importance of
such action at this most opportune moment, all Texas
is stirred up on your contemplated visit and is
anxious to honor you, but the Confederate soldier
until this correction is made, is barred by his very
manhood from participating in a demonstration that
should be one of great unanimity. It should be a
true and unreserved Texas welcome, which would
have the approval of the entire Southern people.</p>

<p>Please understand, there are more Confederate
soldiers and their descendants in Texas today than
perhaps in any other four Southern States. To give
you a better appreciation of what grand result would
follow such a course on your part, I enclose herewith
for your careful perusal the history of an incident
of but a few years ago, wherein the broad-gauged
Governor of Indiana and his patriotic Legislature,
extended the Olive Branch to our Lone Star State,
which was promptly and properly responded to by
our own Executive and Legislature, and permit me
to assure you, that the salutary effect of this sublime
occasion cannot be overestimated in the accomplishment
of its grand purpose. In this instance
only two States were participants; what would be
the effect to have the President of this great Nation
extending the Olive Branch to a remnant band now
fast passing away, whose gallant soldier record was
never equaled in this world’s history?</p>

<p>In conclusion, I will state, although born in a
foreign land—in the City of Bremen—I yield to no
native born citizen a greater love for, and interest in
this country’s future. Reared in the Lone Star State
from childhood, under the shadow of the Alamo,
Goliad and San Jacinto, and through personal acquaintance
with participants of the latter engagement,
I had instilled within me a kindred patriotism
and love of liberty and country that is stronger
today than it has ever been, and which must be my
excuse for submitting this communication, which I
trust will receive your careful and earnest consideration.</p>

<p>Please have returned to me the Indiana papers
at your convenience, as they are highly prized by my
children.</p>

<p>I am with great respect,</p>

<p>When the letter was handed me, with carbon
copies, by my stenographer, I happened to have in
my office Judges Rainey and Talbot, who were going
to take lunch with me. When I handed them the
letter, asking their careful perusal of the same, and
after their return from lunch, to tell me their opinion
about sending it, when Judge Rainey told me
to send it, “It’s a good letter and may have a good
effect.”</p>

<p>Some week or ten days after mailing the letter
I concluded I would see Colonel Simpson in regard
to the matter and handed him a copy of the letter
to read, when, after reading it, he became furious,
stating that it was an outrage to insult the President,
as I had done; first to invite him to our town
and after his accepting the invitation, then insult
him by asking him to take back what he had said.
I called his attention to a clause in the letter,
giving my position on a resolution introduced by a
member of our Camp, inviting him to be the guest
of our Camp while here, which resolution I opposed
and succeeded in defeating, however, the matter was
passed over with Simpson and I am not advised
whether he ever made mention to Roosevelt about
this letter. Simpson stated that he believed that he
would wire Roosevelt not to come, when I told him
he had better do so and not have him come with
these expressions hanging over him and lay himself
subject to being insulted.</p>

<p>When Mr. Roosevelt started to Texas on his
visit, he made a great speech at Louisville, Kentucky,
one of the most conciliatory on sectional differences
he had ever made and paid a magnificent
compliment to the Southern people and especially
the Confederate soldiers. This speech was published
all over the country, as also here in Dallas, and effectually
removed any feeling on the part of the
Southern people engendered through his writings
and expressions, derogatory to our character.</p>

<p>Then followed the magnificent reception and welcome
extended him on his arrival here in Dallas and
his subsequent visits to Fort Worth, Austin and San
Antonio, where he received grand ovations and also
on his subsequent tour of the South, gaining in popularity
to the extent of receiving almost the united
vote of the South, resulting in his sweeping victory
in the November election.</p>

<br/>
<span class='sc'>My Family.</span></h2></div>

<p>Our married life was blessed with seven children—four
girls and three boys—five of whom are
living and happily married. Our oldest, Henrietta
Louise, married Doctor Frank M. Dannelly at
Waxahachie, and they are now living on a large
farm about seven miles from Dallas. Dr. Dannelly
is a native of Georgia, in which State his father was
a prominent physician, and his mother the gifted
poetess, Elizabeth O. Dannelly, who published “Cactus”
immediately after the close of the war, embracing
a number of war poems, notably “The Burning
of Columbia,” a scathing and true denunciation
of this inhuman crime, which gained for it a large
circulation, demanding a second edition; a second
book entitled “Wayside Flowers,” a literary gem,
was also very popular. Their union is blessed with
three boys. The oldest, Henry G., a graduate of
Staunton Military Academy, Virginia, is now in the
fire insurance business in Dallas. Henry G. married
about three years ago Miss Gwendolyn Dunn of Dallas;
they have a sweet baby girl about four months
old, which is now our first great-grandchild. The
other two boys, Frank C. and Perry, are still at
school. Our second daughter, Alice May, married W.
D. Hume in Dallas about sixteen years ago and they
are now making their home in Muskogee, Oklahoma,
where Hume is engaged in the real estate and insurance
business; they have no children. Our third
child, Augustus Lee, was a fine young man, eighteen
years of age, at home with us when, through a mistake
of our family physician he was given an overdose
of medicine, from the effect of which he never
rallied and died in about two hours; this proved
the saddest blow of our lives. Our fourth child is
Irene, who married B. P. McDonald, Jr., of Fort
Scott, Kansas, the son of B. P. McDonald, Sr., one
of the builders of the M. K. &amp; T. road into Texas,
and for many years treasurer of the road. The
old gentleman died here in Dallas a few years ago
while still a director in the road and also owner of
a short-line road into Cleburne, Texas.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Board of Directors of this
company, held in Parsons, Kansas, April 8th, 1909,
the following testimonial to the memory of the deceased
director, Mr. B. P. McDonald, was unanimously
adopted:</p>

<div class='bbox'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>IN MEMORIAM</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Since the last annual meeting of this Board,
death has invaded its membership and claimed its
oldest member in continuous service. After a brief
illness, Benjamin Perry McDonald, of Fort Scott,
Kansas, departed this life on February 16th, 1909,
at Dallas, Texas, where he and his wife were temporarily
sojourning.</p>

<p>“Mr. McDonald was born at Lock Haven, Pennsylvania,
October 18th, 1839. He removed to the
Territory of Kansas August 1st, 1857, saw the Territory
pass to Statehood, and his destiny was ever
afterwards identified with his adopted State.</p>

<p>“He was married November 21st, 1860, to Emma
A. Johnson, who, with their three sons—William A.,
Charles B. and Benjamin Perry, Jr., all now arrived
at manhood’s estate—survive him.</p>

<p>“He was elected mayor of Fort Scott in 1866,
and at the expiration of his term re-elected. He
early engaged in the mercantile and banking business,
and organized the First National Bank of Fort
Scott in January, 1871. He was elected a director
of our Company at its annual meeting on May 15th,
1872, and continued as such every succeeding year
during his life. In 1873 he was elected to the Legislature
of Kansas as a representative from Bourbon
County. In 1874 he built the line southeast from
Fort Scott to the coal fields, a distance of twelve
miles, which was afterwards purchased by the Kansas
City, Fort Scott &amp; Memphis Railroad Company.
In 1881 he built twenty miles of railroad on Long
Island, New York, for the Long Island Railroad
Company. In 1888-9 he built the Sherman, Denison
&amp; Dallas Railway, from Denison to Sherman, Texas,
now a part of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway
of Texas, and in 1901-2 built the Fort Scott, Iola &amp;
Western, from Iola to Moran, Kansas, now owned
and operated by the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway
Company. In 1902 he organized and built the
Dallas, Cleburne &amp; Southwestern Railroad, from
Cleburne to Egan, Texas, of which company he was
the president at the time of his death. This railroad
is now operated under a trackage contract by
the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company
of Texas. He was a director of the Kansas City,
Fort Scott &amp; Memphis Railroad Company and its
predecessor companies from their earliest history
until they passed to the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco
Railroad Company. He lived in Kansas when the
Union Pacific Railway Company, Southern Branch,
now the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company,
was originally incorporated, knew the promoters
of the company, and was always a great
friend of the enterprise. In those early days his
aid and support was of great benefit to the company.
He became a director in 1872, while the road was
being built through the Indian Territory. As a
director he was constant in his attention to the
duties of his office, faithful to the interests of the
Company, and one of its most active and influential
friends. During the receivership of H. C. Cross
and George A. Eddy he was appointed by them as
their treasurer, and served as such during their
whole term, his appointment having been confirmed
by the United States Circuit Court for Kansas, and
his accounts confirmed by that court and found to
be faultless. He was one of the strong men of the
West, and ever ready to serve the interests of this
Company. His acquaintance extended along the entire
line; the people and the employes knew him and
loved him. He was of sound judgment and absolute
honesty. He had troops of friends. He had a more
intimate knowledge of the Company’s history from
the beginning than any other man. His long career
made him seem to be almost a part of the Company’s
life.</p>

<p>“His health was always robust, his nature cheerful,
his sound sense commanding. There was nothing
subservient in his nature; it was all open and
manly. We were shocked and grieved at his sudden
taking off, and unitedly mourn his loss.</p>

<p>“He was buried from his old home at Fort Scott,
under Masonic ceremonies and according to the
rites of the Episcopal Service, and now sleeps on
the banks of the Marmaton which he loved so well.</p>

<p>“We express our deepest sympathy and sincerest
condolence to his widow and sons, and direct that
this memorial be spread upon the records of the
Company and a copy transmitted to them.”</p>

</div>

<p>B. P. and Irene have their home in Birmingham,
Alabama, where he is engaged in the brokerage
business; they are blessed with two interesting children,
a boy and a girl: B. P. the third, and Emma
Louise. Our fifth child, Henry A., is living in Dallas;
Henry was connected with the Kansas City
Southern Railway for about fifteen years, and finally
resigned the general agency of his road in Chicago
and returned to Dallas to make this his permanent
home. While in Chicago he married Ollie Elizabeth
Anderson, who was born and raised in Negaunee,
Michigan; their union is blessed with two sweet
children, Roy Lee and Alice H. Our sixth child,
Roy, died when about five years old at Waxahachie.
Our seventh child is Lessis, the baby girl, who married
Charles Weems Kidwell, born in Louisiana, but
came to Texas with his parents when quite a child;
Kidwell is now connected with the house of Sanger
Brothers, Dallas, as assistant manager of the retail
department, starting in at the wrapping counter
about fifteen years ago; his father was a prominent
physician in Louisiana and died in Dallas years ago;
their union is blessed with two bright boys, Rolla,
seven years old, and Graber, five years old. On the
23rd of last April we passed the 49th milestone of
our married life and if spared until the next 23rd
of April will celebrate our golden wedding, with
five loving children and nine grandchildren and one
great-grandchild in our family circle. Owing to
fast declining health, about four years ago I was
compelled to give up business, and take a much-needed
rest, the first vacation from business cares
in about fifty years; have had two serious spells of
sickness, one in Dallas and another in Detroit, Michigan,
where we went to spend last summer, but
through the loving care of wife and children and
the dispensation of a Divine Providence my life was
again spared, and I am now enjoying better health
than for over fifty years.</p>

<div class='chapter'><span class='pageno' title='441' id='Page_441'></span><h2>CHAPTER XL<br/>
<br/>
<span class='sc'>In Conclusion.</span></h2></div>

<p>This is my story, a record of what I think the
reader will agree has been an eventful life. I have
lived long—I have seen much, both of what was good
and of what was bad; and now when my allotted
span of years must, in the nature of things, be
nearly concluded, I look back and realize that all
of what has happened has been for the best.</p>

<p>There is no bitterness in my heart as I indite
these closing lines. What has passed is past, and
the future, as I see it, holds for the people of the
Southland a great promise. It is my most earnest
wish that this promise shall have a glorious
fulfillment.</p>

<p>My story has not been written for the purpose
of adding to the literature concerning the period
it covers. Rather, it is a personal record, and makes
no claim to literary merit. It is written chiefly for
my children, though I hope it may be found to be
not without interest to the general public.</p>

<p>I feel that I owe it to myself to state that this
book, in its entirety, has been dictated entirely from
memory, and from the personal viewpoint I acquired
during the years of which it treats. It is quite possible
that errors have been made in some matters—that
history will not entirely substantiate all of my
statements, but, in the main, I believe it will be
found that this book is a fairly accurate record
of our many movements.</p>

<p>In closing I feel it is but right and just, and I
know it to be a great pleasure, that I pay my
humble tribute to the great souls with whom I was
fortunate enough to be intimately associated during
the great Civil Strife. Forrest, Wharton, McLaws,
Harrison—they were a gallant company. Dashing,
fearless, strong in their conviction of right, they
were all but unbeatable, though opposed by overwhelming
odds in practically every engagement. I
can see them all now plainly and I hope to see them
again, more plainly, when the Great Trumpeter
shall sound “Taps” for me.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
